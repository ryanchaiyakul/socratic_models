*SPE0:	you'll see a diamond mine on your ma.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	avoid the diamond min.
*SPE1:	due sout.
*SPE0:	going due south followed by eas.
*SPE1:	to the left of the diamond min.
*SPE1:	to the wes.
*SPE0:	east the righ.
*SPE1:	so you want me to go east then sout.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	south then eas.
*SPE0:	we may have a different ma.
*SPE1:	uh-huh righ.
*SPE0:	can you head due sout.
*SPE1:	sorr.
*SPE0:	can you head due sout.
*SPE1:	i can head due sout.
*SPE1:	am i meant i'm meant to draw this on aren't i righ.
*SPE0:	and can you then head to the right past the diamond min.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	go for i.
*SPE1:	how fa.
*SPE0:	you'll see a graveyar.
*SPE0:	do you see a graveyard on your map to the right of the diamond min.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	they've obviously not marked the graveyar.
*SPE1:	how far to the right of diamond mine is i.
*SPE0:	the graveyard is almost halfway in betwee.
*SPE0:	do you have carved stone.
*SPE1:	i have carved stones at the top followed by a ravine followed by an indian countr.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	in between the diamond mine and the carved stones is the graveyard that's where it should b.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	so what you need to do is continue past the diamond mine then past where you think the graveyard i.
*SPE1:	and then sto.
*SPE1:	past where it i.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	go rou-- same under under the graveyard south of the graveyar.
*SPE1:	is the graveyard due east of the diamond min.
*SPE0:	the graveyard'.
*SPE0:	correc.
*SPE1:	so i really shouldn't hit it then if i'm south of the diamond min.
*SPE0:	correc.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	s-- you then come no-- up north just to the left to the west of the carved stone.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	so if you're almost on top of carved stones then you'll totally miss the graveyar.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	right so i am now just directly north of the carved stones and slightly north of the star.
*SPE0:	that's correc.
*SPE0:	so you move east around carved stone.
*SPE1:	the carved stone.
*SPE0:	and then do you have gallows on your ma.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE1:	but they're absolutely miles awa.
*SPE0:	that's correct that's correc.
*SPE0:	all you need to do is go due south from the carved stones as far as you can see the gallows the same level as the gallow.
*SPE1:	pas.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	you should be on top of the indian country correc.
*SPE1:	um and just south of the ravin.
*SPE0:	that's righ.
*SPE0:	do you have a great roc.
*SPE1:	i have a great roc.
*SPE0:	it's to the west of indian countr.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	it's very very southwest of indian countr.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	that's a different great roc.
*SPE0:	okay what you have to do i.
*SPE0:	now that you're paral-- parallel with the gallows righ.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	you're on a level with the gallow.
*SPE1:	i'm on a leve.
*SPE0:	head southwest that's to the left and down past indian countr.
*SPE1:	move west followed by south down t.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	s-- straight southwes.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	not too fa.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm just below indian countr.
*SPE0:	do you see the gold min.
*SPE0:	do you see the gold min.
*SPE1:	which is due we-- due wes.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	i want you to g.
*SPE0:	west making sure that you remain above the gold min.
*SPE0:	understan.
*SPE0:	so you go due west above the gold min.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	but n-- not too far north 'cause otherwise you'll hit the rock so i want you to head just above the gold min.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	are you above the gold mine no.
*SPE1:	i'.
*SPE0:	just to the west of i.
*SPE1:	just i'm just to the east of i.
*SPE1:	do you want me to go f-- slightly furthe.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	i want you to go just past i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	so you're basically in the gap between the gallows and the gold min.
*SPE1:	and the gold mine righ.
*SPE0:	and i want you to go due sou-.
*SPE0:	do you have a trout far.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE1:	bu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	it'.
*SPE1:	that is coming due south followed by due east just above the totem pole just above the totem pole if you had the totem pol.
*SPE0:	that's correct i thin.
*SPE0:	want you to head due south as far south as the trout farm just below the trout far.
*SPE1:	just above the trout far.
*SPE0:	b-- just below the trout far.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm i think i'm just below the trout far.
*SPE0:	and head eas.
*SPE1:	eas.
*SPE1:	and land just below the trout far.
*SPE0:	ah do you have any other obstacle.
*SPE1:	non.
*SPE0:	in the wa.
*SPE0:	well head due east just below the trout farm trying to avoid any obstacles on your wa.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	i'm just below it directly below it i'm not east or west of i.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	now i've got a cavalry stockade on this ma.
*SPE1:	a cavalry a cattle stockad.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	cavalry it's a fort thin.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	so we need to avoid tha.
*SPE1:	well we don'.
*SPE0:	which mean.
*SPE1:	is it directly sout.
*SPE0:	it's almost south of the sou-- the trout farm it's south and slightly to the eas.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	so i want you to go right past the trout farm almost to the edge of the map to make sure we miss i.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	so you're past your totem pole there as well you'r.
*SPE1:	my totem pole is directly below my gold min.
*SPE0:	that's all righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	i want you to go due south no.
*SPE1:	how fa.
*SPE0:	ehm do you have a cattle stockad.
*SPE1:	i d.
*SPE1:	just above i.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	just below it you want to go round the bottom of i.
*SPE1:	do you want me to go to the bottom of the pag.
*SPE0:	uh-huh that's correc.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	i want you to go west below the stockad.
*SPE1:	and below the parched river bed which i don't know if you hav.
*SPE0:	although oh i don't have a river bed s.
*SPE1:	do you have a bandit t-.
*SPE0:	is your river be.
*SPE0:	whereabouts is level becau-.
*SPE1:	do you have a bandit territor.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	directly bas-- directly we-- west of your cattle stockad.
*SPE0:	correc.
*SPE1:	that's in the middle of the tw.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	my map deviates here so i presume that's why you must have an obstacl.
*SPE0:	so what i want you to do is go west as far left as the sta-- s-- just the edge of the "c" of the s-- cattle stockad.
*SPE1:	m-.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	then do you have to go up to avoid th.
*SPE1:	well if there's a very very thin line i ca-- i can go up though ye.
*SPE0:	because that's how this map indicate.
*SPE0:	so i want you to go up not straight up ehm northwes.
*SPE1:	i can go north then wes.
*SPE0:	up up in a curv.
*SPE0:	i want you to go northwest in a one-e.
*SPE1:	right will i go in a one-e.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	it's a curve curve shap.
*SPE1:	right you want me to curv.
*SPE1:	where t-- where am i curving t.
*SPE0:	curving up to the northwest followed by down to the southwes.
*SPE1:	so yo.
*SPE0:	s-- so i want you to go basically curve up and then dow.
*SPE1:	you want me to go you want to curve up to about the level of the great rock i don't know if you have tha.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	not as far as tha.
*SPE1:	see m-.
*SPE0:	only a small curv.
*SPE1:	oh oka.
*SPE0:	to about the m-- the middle of the fencing of the sto-- the cattle stockad.
*SPE1:	north eas.
*SPE0:	northwest to the left of the pag.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	and then curve back down to the bottom of the pag.
*SPE0:	uh-huh that's correc.
*SPE0:	'cause presumably we must be avoiding the river is that correc.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	and then we go due west along the bottom under the bandit territor.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	and then curve round and up to the finis.
*SPE0:	do you have finish on your ma.
*SPE1:	i don't have a finis.
*SPE1:	above my bandit territory about an inch i have a great rock followed by two inches then a totem pol.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	keep going past the bandit terri-- territor.
*SPE1:	due nort.
*SPE0:	are due west of the bandit territory ye.
*SPE1:	i am now west of bandit territor.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	continue until you're about an inch two inches away from the edge of the pag.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and curve up to it the point just above the s-- cactus of the bandit terri-- territor.
*SPE0:	understan.
*SPE1:	just dire-.
*SPE0:	so on the leve.
*SPE1:	just basically right above it but not touching i.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	the level of it but about an inch two inches in from the pag.
*SPE1:	alrigh.
*SPE0:	understand what i mea.
*SPE1:	right so basically just due north to the level of th.
*SPE0:	correc.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and that's your "x" that's your finis.
*SPE1:	is i.
