*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'll write start in 'cause it's off the top of my thin.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	it's actually off the top of mine as wel.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	let's star.
*SPE0:	y-- you got the diamond min.
*SPE1:	re-- yea.
*SPE0:	right you just want to go along to the left of the diamond mine well just down from the start so you're underneath the diamond min.
*SPE1:	down down the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	so you're underneath an.
*SPE0:	the.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm right underneath the centre of the diamond min.
*SPE0:	uh-huh that's right yea.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	you've you sh-- you've not got a wagon wheel n.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	what've you got between the diamond mine and the rift valle.
*SPE1:	where's rift valle.
*SPE0:	up at the top righ.
*SPE1:	a cactu.
*SPE0:	you've got a cactu.
*SPE0:	and is that in a sort o.
*SPE1:	it's it's underneath i.
*SPE1:	it's it'.
*SPE0:	un-.
*SPE0:	underneath the rift valle.
*SPE1:	undernea-- it's underneath the left-hand side of the valle.
*SPE1:	you know how the valley sort of dip.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	on the left-hand side there's a wee cactus up the to.
*SPE0:	oh righ.
*SPE1:	it's it's right underneath tha.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	well you want to go on a slight a a s-- well a slight gradient upwards to to your righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	eh so you're just past the centre of the map i would sa.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	ehm you should be a wee bit past the centre of the ma.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	you want to go ehm just s-- straight up and then round so you go over the top of the rift valley and then down through the centre of i.
*SPE1:	down through the centr.
*SPE0:	yeah you want to go down through the centre of the rift valle.
*SPE1:	right so i've done tha.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	have you got you've got rocks right uh eh underneat.
*SPE1:	i've got rock.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	you want you want to go straight down and then sort of uh ehm half way curve out slightly so you go past diagonally past the rocks to the left-hand side you're missing them by few centimetre.
*SPE1:	right i'm at the bottom of the rocks i've done tha.
*SPE0:	you're at the bottom of the rock.
*SPE0:	right no.
*SPE0:	you you've not got a stone creek to the left of the rocks have yo.
*SPE1:	a wha.
*SPE0:	a stone cree.
*SPE1:	i've got rapid.
*SPE0:	ehm that's to the left and slightly underneath the rocks is i.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	well you want to g.
*SPE1:	is directly underneath the diamond min.
*SPE0:	uh-huh that's righ.
*SPE0:	you want to go down slightly from from the rock level and then curve back up and go over the the rapids so you're on s-- sort of directly on top of the.
*SPE1:	right so i'm over the.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	you want to eh curve down to your at at the side of the at the rapids a few centimetres out from the.
*SPE1:	how man.
*SPE0:	ehm sort of five centimetre.
*SPE0:	just so you'r.
*SPE1:	shi.
*SPE0:	you see the line ehm so you're basically in a line with the end of the very end of the swam.
*SPE0:	you want to go out that fa.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE0:	we're eh straight down slightly curved shape a sort of eye shape so you come you come down t.
*SPE0:	you got stone slab.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	you want to b.
*SPE1:	i've also got a manned for.
*SPE0:	right wel.
*SPE0:	you want to go straight down i don't know miss your manned fort and s-- the level you want to get to in this sort of curve is it should be directl.
*SPE1:	am i going in a curv.
*SPE0:	a slight curve basically s-- basically straight down and then curve slightly so you're eh right underneath the white water and just slightly above the level of the stone slabs it should be in the sort of shape of an ey.
*SPE0:	you know the sideways shape of an eye you get at schoo.
*SPE0:	that sort of idea of a curv.
*SPE0:	right are you ther.
*SPE1:	right i'm underneath the manned fort on a leve.
*SPE1:	have you got stone cree.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	you should be above stone cree.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	that's where i a.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	on the same level as the stone slab.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	now u.
*SPE0:	have you got to your right underneath the rocks have you got an outlaws' hideou.
*SPE1:	saloon ba.
*SPE1:	ah outlaws' hideout yea.
*SPE1:	it's above the.
*SPE0:	yeah it'.
*SPE1:	it's above the rocks above the gold min.
*SPE0:	the gold min.
*SPE1:	i've got a gold min.
*SPE0:	oh right eh.
*SPE1:	just it's no it's it's just below the rock.
*SPE0:	below the rocks righ.
*SPE1:	there's outlaws' hideou.
*SPE0:	tha-- uh-huh that's right that's right below the rock.
*SPE0:	you want to go up eh in a fairly sort of well just a sort of logical gradient so you're underneath the outlaws' hideout just right underneath i.
*SPE1:	right i'm ther.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	have you have you got a noose below the outlaws' hideou.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	there's a gold mine thoug.
*SPE1:	above the right above the noose just just right below the outlaws' hideout slightly it's it's directly above the noos.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	you want to curve out slightly so you're to the right of the the gold mine and to the right of the noose and then just come straight down to the bottom eh right of the noos.
*SPE1:	right that's where i a.
*SPE0:	s-- righ.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	you want to keep curving down to well basically keep curving down 'til you're abov.
*SPE0:	you've not got you've not got a swan pond n.
*SPE1:	a wha.
*SPE0:	you've not got a swan pon.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	right wel.
*SPE0:	you want to keep curving down you're at the bottom right of the noose you want to curve down so you're just a-- ehm sort of a few centimetres five centimetres from maybe above the en.
*SPE0:	you know the writing at the bottom the "n" "a" "q" "c" "6" stuf.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	you want to be just above that and your level is about roughly the middle of the saloon bar has your leve.
*SPE1:	right i'm ther.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	a few centimetres to the left of that i've got the swan pon.
*SPE1:	how many roughl.
*SPE0:	ehm don't don't write anything yet by the way eh.
*SPE0:	i'm talking about three centimetre.
*SPE0:	probabl.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	i see so you've got to basically from where you are go along very slightly and then curve up over the swan pond and then back down to the same level that you're at so the curve you want to get is basically to the top of the saloon bar is the level curve up there and then curve down ehm about well see you'r.
*SPE1:	how long is this swa.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	the end of it is at directly down from the end of the stone slab.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i've got that and then i go down to where i wa.
*SPE0:	y-- no n-- aye the level you were yeah that's righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and from there you want to curve eh so you're underneath the saloon ba.
*SPE1:	underneath i.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm underneath the "o.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE0:	right you're underneath the "o.
*SPE0:	right wel.
*SPE0:	basically this is the bit i messed up a bit last tim.
*SPE0:	the finish is just keeping going to your left and curving up past the saloon bar and it's a few ce-- it's about three or f-- maybe four centimetres out five centimetres out from the left-hand side of your page and it's just above the roof of the saloon bar and that's the finis.
