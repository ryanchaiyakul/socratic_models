*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	you have a l-- a yacht club in the bottom right corne.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	slightly to the left of that you have to draw a point on a level with the c-- the top of the camera shop and then draw a straight line from the corner of the allotments to that poin.
*SPE1:	so have you got a flight museum on you.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	so i've got to go along from the allotments to the righ.

*SPE0:	you got tha.
*SPE1:	mmhm.

*SPE0:	have you over th-- o-- are you eh curved over the monaster.
*SPE1:	mmhmm above the monaster.
*SPE0:	you go down to the left-hand side in this following the same curv.
*SPE1:	so it's right round the monaster.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	then at that point the curve reverses itself and dips round to a level which is vertically at the left-hand side of the alpine garde.
*SPE0:	roughly but it ends at the same line as the disused monastery in a curve that dips down from the left-hand side of i.
*SPE1:	s-.
*SPE0:	then you go straight up to the left-hand side of the alpine garde.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	then to the right 'til the other side of the lef-- the alpine garden and straight u.
*SPE0:	now have you got a youth hostel marked ther.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	well you go up about four inches from the alpine garden and then draw a line two inches to the righ.
*SPE1:	have you got parked va.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE0:	it's it's below the parked va.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	it's about it's below the level of the picket fenc.
*SPE0:	have you got tha.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	it's about an inch below the level of the picket fenc.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and then you go to your righ.
*SPE1:	underneath the parked va.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE0:	to appro-- to roughly about the middle of the parked van a line and tha.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and do you have a telephone bo.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	well d.
*SPE0:	you the next stage is you have to draw a diagonal line from the right-hand side of the youth hostel down t.
*SPE1:	i don't have youth hoste.
*SPE0:	oh righ.
*SPE0:	well from that point that i've just gone roun.
*SPE1:	mmhm.

*SPE0:	there's a v-- there's a hori-- horizontal line that goes under the telephone bo.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	eh that's on a line with the yacht club and you've to draw a diagonal line between that and the point you've just ended a.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	right i've done tha.
*SPE0:	then you go up to about slightly above the top of the telephone bo.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	then the path curves it in a follows a curve rising to the left until it reaches a line approximately level with the middle of east lake that's a ve-- a vertical line approximately the middle of east lak.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	so i've got a level cross between telephone box and the east lak.
*SPE1:	so i curve round tha.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	to the middle of the east lak.
*SPE0:	to a line approximately just it's below the m-.
*SPE1:	yeah uh-hu.
*SPE0:	east lake it's approximately level with the the bottom of the picket fenc.
*SPE1:	mm righ.
*SPE1:	done tha.
*SPE0:	right and from there it's a straight line to another line which is ehm level with the top of the picket fence and the furthest most part of east lake that bulge that goes out the left-hand sid.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	so sorry say that agai.
*SPE0:	on a l-- eh the finish point is on a line level with the picket fenc.
