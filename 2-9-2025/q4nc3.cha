*SPE1:	up at the top left-hand pag.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and you've got a burnt forest beside you just below i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	what my map says is it's actually a curved line but i don't know whether to give you a curved line or a straight line i'll give you a curved line righ.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	have you got anything like to the r-- to the left of the burnt fores.
*SPE1:	i've got a burnt forest and then straight below it i've got a carpenter's cottage then a ravine that's all i've go.
*SPE0:	well i haven't got the carpenter's cottag.
*SPE0:	is that directly beside the ravin.
*SPE1:	it'.
*SPE1:	uh-huh it's directl.
*SPE1:	well a wee bit up but i-- near enoug.
*SPE0:	a wee bit u.
*SPE0:	have you got the remote villag.
*SPE1:	n-- up at up at this sid.
*SPE0:	beside the burnt fores.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	no well what i suggest you do lllll ehm is like right there's a there's a line about quarter of the way down and it's the bottom of it it's from the start right and the bottom of it is in parallel with the ravin.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	you know the wor.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	ravin.
*SPE0:	have you got tha.
*SPE1:	i've got ravin.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	so it's lik.
*SPE1:	so i start from start an-.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and it's like a curv.
*SPE1:	will i go underneath the burnt fores.
*SPE0:	no no you don'.
*SPE1:	no sorr.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	it's just like a r-- a kind of slight curv.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	uh-huh and it's just to parallel with the ravine the word ravin.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	aye wait a minut.
*SPE1:	which way am i goin.
*SPE1:	right i'm at the star.
*SPE0:	sorry yea.
*SPE0:	it's .
*SPE1:	you know what i mean i'.
*SPE0:	it's a curve to the righ.
*SPE1:	a curve to the righ.
*SPE1:	you'v.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	not got the burnt forest you have got ah no you haven'.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	i have got the burnt fores.
*SPE0:	and it's not through it it's lik.
*SPE1:	so i'm going a curve and it goes down to the ravin.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	no not to the ravine parallel with i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	jus-.
*SPE0:	bu-- right the bottom of the curve is like parallel with the word star.
*SPE0:	do you know what i mea.
*SPE0:	it's just a curv.
*SPE0:	know what a curve i.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	right and i'm going towards down towards the ravin.
*SPE0:	well the bottom of i.
*SPE1:	sorry i can'.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	just draw a straight lin.
*SPE1:	oh right oh god a straight lin.
*SPE0:	okay just draw a straight lin.
*SPE1:	oh but it's kind of curv.
*SPE0:	that'll be easy uh-hu.
*SPE1:	but i'm still up at i'm still up at the top of pag.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	right i get what you mean no.
*SPE1:	at the top of the burn.
*SPE1:	right okay righ.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and you s-- finish your curve at where's the start you know parallel ehm just parallel no no no no f-- just down from star.
*SPE1:	right okay okay i've got it i've got it i've got i.
*SPE0:	okay an-.
*SPE0:	and it's like parallel to the ravine the bottom of it is like well not parallel but on the same line as the ravin.
*SPE1:	ah righ.
*SPE1:	on the straight line i've go-- it's kind of like as though it's just dubbed directly above the "a.
*SPE0:	wha.
*SPE1:	sorry on you g.
*SPE1:	right i've drawn this lin.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	is it is it stopping just down from start in a straight line from star.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	well it's kind of curv.
*SPE0:	uh-huh good goo.
*SPE0:	curvy to the righ.
*SPE1:	i'm all right curvy to the righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then you go across and sto.
*SPE1:	this is a-- by the way this is about like five centimetres down from the top of the page this about righ.
*SPE0:	ay.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	aye right oka.
*SPE0:	it should stop at v-- you know doing the just in a straight line from the ravin.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	right i've got i.
*SPE0:	in a straight line to like a straight line across lik.
*SPE1:	towards the pine grov.
*SPE1:	you got a pine grov.
*SPE0:	no uh-huh yeah yea.
*SPE0:	no not across to ther.
*SPE0:	vertical right a vertical line this is quite good vertical line and stop just where the "r" is in forest down from fores.
*SPE0:	do you know what i mea.
*SPE1:	oh wait a minute a vertical lin.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	you mean i'm going down towards the ravine i'll be in the ravin.
*SPE0:	oh no n.
*SPE0:	a horizontal lin.
*SPE0:	right a vertical .
*SPE0:	horizontal line mmhm.
*SPE1:	towards the righ.
*SPE1:	and where do i sto.
*SPE0:	just down from where the "r" i.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	from pine grov.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then and the.
*SPE1:	oh i'm not allowed to mov.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	go up again ehm you know how you got the ravine just go up and past the ravin.
*SPE0:	have you got the remote village n.
*SPE1:	i'm a-- i'm really past the ravine by no.
*SPE1:	i'm at the pine grove i'm at at towards the right-hand side of the pag.
*SPE0:	well go back don't pass the pi-- don't pass the ravin.
*SPE1:	oh the "r" of the ravin.
*SPE0:	pardo.
*SPE1:	i thought you meant the "r" of the pine grov.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	right wait a minu-.
*SPE0:	don't pass the ravine oka.
*SPE0:	it's the "r" of the burnt forest i was talking abou.
*SPE1:	oh so you this line was only about two centimetres lon.
*SPE0:	uh-huh yea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm not past the ravin.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE0:	and go u.
*SPE1:	u.
*SPE0:	up no.
*SPE1:	up towards the top of the pag.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	up towards just right up to the top of the ravine past the bird.
*SPE1:	you mean down to the ravin.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	up right up to the top of the ravin.
*SPE1:	i'm above the ravin.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	you're kiddin.
*SPE1:	right okay wait a minute righ.
*SPE1:	i came from the burnt fores.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	and i came and i did a d-- a kind of a curvy right just to like towards lik.
*SPE1:	you see where it says burnt fores.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	just about parallel where it says burnt forest so i'm up ther.
*SPE1:	do you know where i a.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	about five centimetres from the top of the pag.
*SPE0:	do you want to start agai.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	right start oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	vertical line down to the r-- ravin.
*SPE1:	oh just vertically dow.
*SPE0:	uh-huh vertically dow.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	but missing out anything that might be in betwee.
*SPE1:	down toward.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	can you do thi.
*SPE1:	ay.
*SPE0:	i think you ca.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	right vertically down 'til you're like in a straigh.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm at diag-.
*SPE1:	right i know what you mean no.
*SPE1:	right i'm at the ravin.
*SPE1:	and then i go along to where it says "r" of the ravin.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	you go along to where it says "r" of the burnt fores.
*SPE1:	oh righ.
*SPE0:	a horizontal lin.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	just in line with the "r" of the burnt fores.
*SPE1:	oh right i've got you now right i've got tha.
*SPE0:	and then you go up a vertical lin.
*SPE1:	to the top of the ravin.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	and i've got the carpenter's cottag.
*SPE1:	so i have to miss tha.
*SPE0:	yeah you'll have to miss tha.
*SPE1:	so see the wee seagulls at the ravin.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	just about up ther.
*SPE0:	above that yea.
*SPE1:	oh i've got you now righ.
*SPE0:	and then a horizontal lin.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	under the remote villag.
*SPE0:	have you got tha.
*SPE1:	i've not got the remote village is i.
*SPE0:	well don't go very far just go a little bit above the seagulls in the ravin.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then draw a horizontal lin.
*SPE1:	just to about the end of the ravin.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	well a wee bit furthe.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	have to just towards halfway between the pine grove n.
*SPE1:	you got the pine grov.
*SPE0:	no i ha-- oh yeah i have yea.
*SPE0:	right uh-huh across to ther.
*SPE1:	oh as far as tha.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	it doesn't matter i'm just going to tell you to draw straight line.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	and like you go right go in a vertical line down just until you you're underneath the pine grov.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE0:	oh i can't get yo.
*SPE0:	have you got anythin.
*SPE1:	i've got an avalanch.
*SPE0:	i haven't got tha.
*SPE0:	where's tha.
*SPE1:	right see the pine grov.
*SPE1:	it's just below it to your righ.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	below it righ.
*SPE0:	tell you what miss ou.
*SPE0:	have you got i don't think you'll have the concealed hideou.
*SPE1:	i d.
*SPE0:	have you oh you d.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	oh well right just draw a line right draw a line unti.
*SPE0:	what you've got to do i.
*SPE0:	i would suppose that your avalanche is ehm miss-- right your avalanche is like outwith the lin.
*SPE0:	do you know what i mea.
*SPE1:	uh-huh yeah it i.
*SPE0:	so like the line is within well m-- in my map i think the line is within the avalanch.
*SPE1:	the avalanche is quite far to the righ.
*SPE0:	okay righ.
*SPE0:	what you do is w-- wh-- in my picture i've got two och how could you say bumps right i would say the avalanche is missed out it's drawn to miss out the avalanch.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	but includes within this line it includes the concealed hideou.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	so could you draw something that woul.
*SPE1:	do you want me to go down towards the concealed hideou.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	missing out the avalanch.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and goi-- and go round the concealed hideout concealed hideou.
*SPE1:	to your righ.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	go round it and include it in the lin.
*SPE1:	right i'm just drawing my line underneath the word concealed hideout no.
*SPE0:	oh good righ.
*SPE0:	you d-- have you done that yeah d-- drawn it underneat.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	i've drawn my lin.
*SPE1:	and it's just i'm just at the down below the "t" of concealed hideou.
*SPE0:	oh right oka.
*SPE0:	well draw a a horizontal line ove.
*SPE0:	have you got the boat hous.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	over to the boat hous.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	you mean vertical down to the boat hous.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	horizontal over to the boat hous.
*SPE1:	oh right horizontal over to the boat house righ.
*SPE1:	okay i'm directly above the boat house no.
*SPE0:	you're above i.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	my my boat house is down below crane ba.
*SPE0:	i haven't got tha.
*SPE0:	you're above the boat house thoug.
*SPE1:	i've got a boat house there's crane bay and i've got a boat house jus.
*SPE1:	do-.
*SPE0:	okay righ.
*SPE0:	oh i've got two boat house.
*SPE1:	alrigh.
*SPE1:	do you do you see do you see where my boat house i.
*SPE0:	ehm uh-hu.
*SPE0:	right well go back up again to the concealed hideou.
*SPE1:	i'm at the concealed hideou.
*SPE0:	and you're you've drawn a horizontal lin.
*SPE1:	i'm jus.
*SPE1:	see where the boat house i.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	b-- the boat house at crane ba.
*SPE0:	i've got tw.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE1:	mm the one the one further down the pag.
*SPE0:	uh-huh yea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm just about my line's just about five centimetres above i.
*SPE0:	okay that's goo.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	draw it over to the othe.
*SPE0:	have you got another boat hous.
*SPE1:	i've only got one boat hous.
*SPE0:	oh righ.
*SPE0:	well i've got tw.
*SPE0:	i've got one parallel to the concealed hideout well just abou.
*SPE1:	oh righ.
*SPE1:	i've no.
*SPE0:	well what you could do is draw a line underneath the concealed hideout until you ge.
*SPE0:	right see the "b" of crane ba.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	well until you stop at the "b.
*SPE1:	oh righ.
*SPE1:	i've gone along too far the.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	stop at the "b.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	and then go right down horizontal i mean vertical go right dow.
*SPE0:	you know how you've got that have you got the crane bay have you got the actual outline of i.
*SPE1:	to wha.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	well go right dow.
*SPE1:	until i touch the outlin.
*SPE0:	no no no no n.
*SPE0:	until you're nearly touching it you're maybe just like half a mil-- half a centimetr.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	away from i.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	that's m.
*SPE0:	and f-- and follow i.
*SPE0:	you know how that wee curv.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	there's a wee curv.
*SPE0:	follow that wee curv.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	down towards the boat hous.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	the other way sorry the other way to your lef.
*SPE1:	off to my lef.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	just follow that wee hum.

*SPE0:	have you come to the bum.
*SPE1:	i've come to the bum.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	follow it agai.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	just so far like ehm uh maybe about two centimetre.
*SPE1:	mmhm.

*SPE1:	i've got the pebbled shor.
*SPE0:	ehm well come round right follow the line down 'til you're maybe about och say about a centimetre and a half above the pebbled shor.
*SPE0:	do you know what i mea.
*SPE0:	draw a curv.
*SPE1:	right just following the coast lin.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	right okay that's m.
*SPE0:	and then come up over the pebbled shor.
*SPE1:	above i.

*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	and then just 'til you're righ.
*SPE1:	i've got washed stones below i.

*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	are you maybe are right tell me where you are just now are you lik.
*SPE1:	i'm just at the right of the washed stones at the left-hand side of the pag.
*SPE0:	i've not got washed stone.
*SPE0:	so are you two mi-- two about two centimetres above from the bottom of the page just no.
*SPE1:	i'.
*SPE1:	ay.
*SPE1:	i'm abou.
*SPE0:	are you if in parallel with the flagshi.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	or in the same leve.
*SPE0:	oh well that's i.
*SPE1:	well n.
*SPE1:	i could go down but i've got the the flagship there's a wee there's a wee bit of bay sticking ou.
*SPE0:	uh-huh righ.
*SPE0:	where are you where have you stoppe.
*SPE1:	i've stopped about six centimetres up i mean i'm i'm about three or four centimetres up from the flagshi.
*SPE0:	oh n.
*SPE0:	what the line stops at the flagship well not at the flagship about two centimetres away from i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	what do you want me to do do you want me t.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE1:	do you want do you want me to miss that wee jut out of the bay draw a line round tha.
*SPE0:	wher.
*SPE1:	do you know how the flagshi.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	there's a wee bit of bay that juts ou.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	do you want me to draw a line round that so i'm going to miss i.
*SPE0:	where are you oh oh what l-- what side of the pebbled shore are yo.
*SPE1:	i'm near en-- i'm near enough the right now 'cause i had to miss the washed stone.
*SPE0:	wha.
*SPE0:	you're at the right of i.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	you should be at the left of i.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	could you go roun.
*SPE1:	i'll go round the washed stones the other wa.
*SPE0:	to i don't have the washed stone.
*SPE0:	right s.
*SPE1:	you want me to be at the left of the pebbled shor.
*SPE0:	uh-huh i want you to go round the left of the pebbled shor.
*SPE1:	oh i did do tha.
*SPE0:	oh you did d.
*SPE0:	you said the righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	i kno.
*SPE1:	but i'm now at the 'cause i've had to miss the washed stones so i'm now near enough the righ.
*SPE0:	where are your washed stone.
*SPE1:	the washed stones ar.
*SPE1:	see the pebbled shor.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	they're about three centimetres down to the lef.
*SPE0:	oh right oka.
*SPE0:	all right so you jutted them ou.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	so i came back round to the right and jutted them ou.
*SPE0:	oh goo.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	so you're now so where are you now right you're abou.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	see the flagshi.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	see the wee bit of bay that's jutting ou.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm exactly two centimetres up above that about that wee that that wee tip comes ou.
*SPE0:	well go down until you're in a v-.
*SPE0:	right see the windows of the flagshi.
*SPE1:	ay.
*SPE0:	this stops at the window.
*SPE1:	can i go actually into crane ba.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i go dow.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	you're away fr-- right you see the wee bit that's jutting ou.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	just across from the window.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	you're about a centimetre and a half away from tha.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	that's where i am just no.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	that's the finis.
*SPE1:	oh righ.
*SPE1:	so i don't actually touch the flagshi.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i just cr-- put a cross and finis.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	so it's about a centimetre up from that wee jutty-out bit that's the finis.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	are you at the windows are you finished just in a v-- horizontal line from the windows of the flagshi.
*SPE1:	ah it's have i got to go horizontall.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	oh it's it's it's in a wee recess bi.
*SPE0:	sorr.
*SPE1:	see the how you've got the jutty-out bit then it goes in and ou.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	is that where the finish i.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i c-- .
*SPE0:	but it's not actually in crane ba.
*SPE1:	aye i know where you ar.
