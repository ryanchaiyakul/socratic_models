*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	at the very top of the page there's a cros.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	do you have a diamond mine just below i.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	about an inch to your right draw a line straight dow.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	c-- start from the cross yea.
*SPE0:	'til it's abo-- 'til it's an inch below the diamond min.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	do you have a wagon-.
*SPE1:	it's directly down yea.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	do you have a a wagon wheel just to the right of the the diamond min.
*SPE1:	mm no i haven't got any wagon whee.
*SPE0:	what's the f-- next thing to its righ.
*SPE1:	to the right i've got eventually a cactu.
*SPE0:	you don't have a rift valle.
*SPE1:	oh i've got a rift valley above tha.
*SPE0:	yeah oka.
*SPE1:	y-- you've got the rift valley right up at the top right-hand sid.
*SPE0:	you're drawing your line dow.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	underneath draw a line to your right and straight along at a slight angle rising up towards the back of the corner of the pag.
*SPE1:	towards the right-hand corne.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	ehm that's going to take me f-- pretty near to the cactus thing so i'm trying to avoid tha.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	hang on hang on righ.
*SPE1:	an inch to the right of the diamond min.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	yeah and then straight down to an inch below i.
*SPE0:	should be now yeah if your line's below the diamond mine you should be oka.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	and then go st-- straight along to my right which is your right as well go straight along to the righ.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	to right to the edge of the pag.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	to about halfway to page about four inches off before the pag.
*SPE1:	er right oka.
*SPE1:	that takes me t.
*SPE0:	then go s-- up to almost the very top of the pag.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then to your right agai.
*SPE1:	okay hang o.
*SPE0:	well bu.
*SPE1:	have you got the rift valley ther.
*SPE1:	'cause i've got the rift valley right up in that r-- top right-hand corne.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	you're going to actually go through the rift valle.
*SPE0:	like the rift valley's like a half moo.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	you're going to go and you're going to come right through you're going to like intersect right almost at the midpoint of the rift valle.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	go through the centr.
*SPE1:	i'll just take it up and go through the centre yea.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	like right through the sort of midpoint like through the it's like a "u" and you're going right through the midpoint you want to be down into the "u" as though you were going if you know what i mea.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	erm i'm not that so i should be below there when i'm taking the line u.
*SPE0:	yeah belo.
*SPE0:	and then like into the rift valle.
*SPE1:	okay righ.
*SPE0:	and right throug.
*SPE1:	i'll have to t-- i'll i'll have to kind of change it slightly 'cause i've taken it on the wrong side of this cactus thing i think i'll just do a slight detou.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	and just take it straight through towards the top of the pag.
*SPE0:	straight through yea.
*SPE1:	alright there we g.
*SPE0:	and you want to go to the sort of midpoint of the rift valley you want to intersect in the midpoint of the rift valley going down the wa.
*SPE0:	do you know what i mea.
*SPE1:	not quit.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you've got in you're above the rift valley first of all righ.
*SPE1:	was .
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	above the rift valle.
*SPE0:	you go above the rift valley and then you start coming down as in into the rift valley and you intersect like the line of the rift valley in the midpoin.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	mm that's not where i am no.
*SPE1:	right so where hang on right s.
*SPE0:	your rift valley is "u"-shaped yea.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	in a c-- like as the two ends are pointing up towards top of the pag.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	and i was supposed to start above it there and come down through i.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE1:	i've done it back to front but never mind righ.
*SPE1:	eh so i should now be below i.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	through the midpoin.
*SPE0:	below your rift valley about four inches down do you have rock.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	and do you have a stone cree.
*SPE1:	erm n.
*SPE1:	i've got the rocks i've got like two rock.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	and again a couple of inches below that i've got outlaws' hideou.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	i've got tha.
*SPE1:	but i haven't got anything else round about that are.
*SPE0:	you've got nothing to like the left of i.
*SPE1:	er right over i've got rapids about three inches across from the rock.
*SPE0:	well i've got a stone creek ther.
*SPE0:	see in betwee.
*SPE0:	you want to go from the rift valley right down in between the rock.
*SPE1:	thr-- through the centre of the two rock.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	no not sorr.
*SPE0:	i i i don't mean through the two rocks i mean like to the left of the two rocks about an inc.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	so is i.
*SPE1:	well okay alright i think i've got thi.
*SPE1:	the first part of this is a total stat.
*SPE0:	do you have white wate.
*SPE1:	er well that'll be the rapid.
*SPE0:	yeah that's tru.
*SPE0:	and you don't have a stone creek above your white wate.
*SPE1:	no i've go.
*SPE0:	or a swamp to its lef.
*SPE1:	i've got the swam.
*SPE1:	and like directly above the rapids i've got a diamond min.
*SPE0:	to its lef.
*SPE0:	well that's a a stone c-- s.
*SPE1:	but you know right right back at the star.
*SPE0:	oh no aye yea.
*SPE0:	you don't have like above the the rapids to its s-- slightly to its right you don't have a stone cree.
*SPE1:	nop.
*SPE0:	no wel.
*SPE0:	take your line right down to your rapids which is my white water and just lik.
*SPE1:	am i going above or below her.
*SPE1:	at the moment i'm at at the moment i'm just slightly to the left of the rock.
*SPE0:	abov.
*SPE1:	so where's where do i go from ther.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE0:	right round the white water or right round the rapid.
*SPE1:	taking it round from the top o.
*SPE0:	from the to.
*SPE0:	but stay quite close 'cause you don't otherwise you're going to be in that stone cree.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i'm now at the top left-hand corner of the rapid.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE0:	come down come straight down to below that like j-- a straight line down but take it to at least two inches below your outlaws' hideout not like you mean like s-- straight down but lik.
*SPE1:	oh i see what you mean yea.
*SPE0:	in like length further down from that on the pag.
*SPE1:	have you got a manned fort below the rapid.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	'cause i've got that interrupting er like dir-- almost directly below it slightly to the left i've got a manned for.
*SPE0:	you got another stone cree.
*SPE1:	eh oh righ.
*SPE0:	and stone slab.
*SPE1:	yeah it's right the way down below the manned for.
*SPE1:	have you not got anything in between the rapids and the stone creek down at the botto.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	well yea.
*SPE0:	slightly to its right there's some stone slab.
*SPE1:	yeah no in right in between the two of those i've got a manned for.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	how far down's the manned for.
*SPE1:	er about two inches maybe two and a hal.
*SPE0:	take it further down go right under the manned go under your manned fort and between your stone cree.
*SPE1:	the stone creek and the stone slab.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	go r-- go down under your manned fort and the.
*SPE1:	which way do you want me to go round the r-- left or the right-hand side of tha.
*SPE0:	go round the left-hand sid.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE0:	when you get to the b-- when you get below it go up towards your ha-- outlaws' hideout and sort of take the line s-- sloping up so it's like going straight up towards the outlaws' hideout or it's going close to the hideout it's like you're so you're going to the other side of the pag.
*SPE1:	right s.
*SPE1:	it's a diagonal across the page towards tha.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	that sounds a bit drasti.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	right below your outlaws' hideout a good bit below do you have a noos.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	have you got a gold mine there as well jus.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	just to below and to the right of the outlaws' hideout i've got a gold min.
*SPE0:	no i've got nothin.
*SPE1:	i'm going to be quite wealthy i've got all the mine.
*SPE0:	do you have a swan pon.
*SPE1:	erm n.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	do you have a saloon ba.
*SPE1:	er i've got a saloon bar right down on the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	head for that and we'll be oka.
*SPE0:	no ehm see the outlaws' hideou.
*SPE1:	short cu.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	you're right up beside tha.
*SPE1:	mmhmm i'.
*SPE1:	ju-- well i've got it at the moment i'm slightly below it bu.
*SPE0:	you've got a gold mine a gold mine you got a gold mine below tha.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	far below i.
*SPE1:	er.
*SPE0:	directly below i.
*SPE1:	not directly below i.
*SPE1:	just just below the "u" if you take it down from the hideout er that that's just that's just at the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	ay.
*SPE0:	that'll be where my s-- that'll be where my stone lab.
*SPE0:	that'll be where my stone slabs ar.
*SPE1:	but are your stone slabs not kind of at the other side of tha.
*SPE0:	i would imagin.
*SPE1:	'cause my stone slabs are like maybe what two and a half inches below and to the lef.
*SPE0:	aye right oka.
*SPE0:	so you're saying they're it's to the right then this thin.
*SPE1:	the gold mine i.
*SPE0:	right above the noos.
*SPE1:	mm aye directly above the noose that's a better descriptio.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	well-.
*SPE0:	from where that line is that you've drawn go straight down 'til you pass the noose and you're passing the noose like on its right-hand side by a wee bi.
*SPE1:	on its right-hand sid.
*SPE0:	if you know what i mea.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	so that's like towards the edge of the paper her.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	right there we g.
*SPE1:	i've come right down below tha.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	then you don't have anything else down lik.
*SPE1:	i've got the saloon bar and i've got the stone creek directly across to the left of the noose er but i've got nothing else in that area at al.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	you know like below that i should say i mean in the m-- in the middle and to b-- above them and the stone slab.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you know how the like on line with the saloon ba.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	about two inches along i've got a swans pon.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i've to avoid tha.
*SPE0:	you want to avoid tha.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE1:	so go above i.
*SPE0:	need to go go up above i.
*SPE0:	and then down and under the saloon bar to the finis.
*SPE1:	phoa.
*SPE0:	is that yo.
*SPE1:	that's it yea.
*SPE0:	yee-h.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	home boy let's see you don.
*SPE1:	what the first bit of that was a total disaste.
*SPE0:	he'll probably kill me her.
*SPE1:	'cause i came through the rift valley the wrong way i was supposed to come from the top and go down 'til like down through i.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	'cause i well i came from underneath don't know what i was doing down ther.
