*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	so you've got to miss that as wel.
*SPE1:	so where do i go what c-- side of the plane crash do i go t.

*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	just mirror that on the bottom until you're s-- you start m-- until you finish that where you started to do a curve at the to.
*SPE0:	see where you started to curve up above the lak.
