*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	ehm along above where it says crane bay you keep quite close to the coast and above the "e" of crane bay you're making a ninety degree turn to your left agai.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	towards the reclaimed field.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and you've got to skirt round them ehm taking a right tur.
*SPE1:	mmhm.

*SPE1:	m.
*SPE0:	that's just a habit of mine to start at the bottom of a map and work my way u.
*SPE0:	sorr.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	bit young for a missu.

*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	and in a more or less straight line sloping slightly down the way head along for about another two inches then slope down towards seven beeche.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	ehm curve round slightly to your righ.
*SPE1:	to my righ.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE1:	as i look at i.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE0:	because you're going round the chapel you should be heading down towards the reclaimed fields where we got to the last tim.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	ehm you want to go you want to circle the reclaimed fields right round to your right you want to go round the right of them as you look at i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and come along for oh about two inches again and then head down straight down southwards towards the ba.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and stick fairly close to the coast for about an inch and a hal.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	then slope down towards vast meadow in between vast meadow and attractive cliffs ehm an angle sort o.
*SPE1:	wait a minut.
*SPE0:	uh-u.

*SPE0:	i sound as if i'm making an awful lot of mistakes her.
*SPE1:	no it's my old one i'm s-- scribbling ou.
*SPE0:	ehm head down at a southwesterly angle towards vast meadow and the attractive cliff.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you should be in between them you head down in a straight line between vast meadow and attractive cliff.
*SPE1:	a straight line between the.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	until about the "a" of vast meado.
*SPE1:	wha.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and again the same sort of southwesterly angle down to where it says attractive cliff.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then a much more westerly angle for about an inch and then following the side of the map down and then curve round eastwards towards the finis.
