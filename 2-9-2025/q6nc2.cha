*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	the thing the cross that says start yea.
*SPE0:	does i.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	now you go down on the the left-hand side the telephon.
*SPE1:	the left-hand side righ.
*SPE0:	down past the stone circl.
*SPE1:	the wha.
*SPE0:	the stone circl.
*SPE1:	i've not got a stone circl.
*SPE1:	you got a have you got a broken gate to the right and at the bottom of the telephone kios.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	and underneath right underneath the s-- telephone kiosk at the bottom there's a stone circl.
*SPE1:	oh righ.
*SPE1:	i don't have tha.
*SPE1:	no.
*SPE1:	how f-- roughly how far down is tha.
*SPE0:	eh say about five centimetres on the ma.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so it's about in a l-- in a straight down from telephone kios.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	and about in a line with the the writing of broken gate roughl.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	the broken gate ends the left-hand side of broken gate is the right-hand side the stone circl.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	whe-- whe-.
*SPE1:	and where's the st-- the other side the stone circle e.
*SPE0:	eh the left-hand side of the telephone kios.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	and the bottom it's just at the writing of broken gate o.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	it's it's eh it's about three centimetres down from the broken gat.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	which is called farmer's gat.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i want to go from start to underneat.
*SPE0:	underneath the stone circl.
*SPE1:	sort of it's directly down from telephone kios.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	right i'm ther.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you're underneath i.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you go up past the end of the stone circl.
*SPE1:	eh underneath the broken gat.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	you go up past the stone circl.
*SPE0:	and around the top of the the farmer's gate the gat.
*SPE1:	so i go between the the circle the stone circle and the gate the.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	so that's quite a small space is it i i presum.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	and where where should i end u.
*SPE0:	just stop above the farmer's gat.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	directly above i.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	you ther.
*SPE1:	uh-huh straight above i.
*SPE0:	right no.
*SPE0:	do you have the meado.
*SPE1:	yeah i d.
*SPE1:	on the bottom r-- bottom righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	you just ignore that completel.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	what do well basically you go up sort of a very slight diagonal line until you're above the meado.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so it's just a sort of very small gradient above the meado.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	have you got what have you got the lak.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	i'm i'm und-- at the moment i'm underneath overnight accommodation and just almost in the i'm just in the beginning of the meado.
*SPE0:	i don't have tha.
*SPE0:	i don't have overnight accommodatio.
*SPE1:	right wel.
*SPE1:	that's just eh if you take the the left of the meadow and go straight up to eh then the overnight accommodation is straight up from the left of the meadow and it's just slightly above the well it's actually in a line with the start writin.
*SPE1:	if you put a wee "x" there for overnight accommodatio.
*SPE0:	yeah wel.
*SPE0:	that's that'll be that's probably where you should go the.
*SPE0:	if that's overnight accommodation probably want go ther.
*SPE1:	o.
*SPE1:	wh-- where's your map say to g.
*SPE0:	it doesn't say go anywhere it just it turns turns northward.
*SPE1:	oh right i se.
*SPE0:	a-- at that poin.
*SPE1:	so i so it's going to overnight accommodation the.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	where's it head after tha.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	well it goe.
*SPE1:	i'll just just tell briefly and then i'll go to overnight accommodation we'll start again just sort of point of interes.
*SPE0:	it goes up for it goes up for about ten ten or twelve centimetres it skirt-- it goes round the north of the the ruined monaster.
*SPE1:	right right wel.
*SPE1:	i'll i'll move into overnight accommodatio.
*SPE1:	and it just goes straight up from where i say overnight accommodation would be just right up northwards yea.
*SPE0:	o.
*SPE0:	where how f-- is it is your overnight accommodation directly above the meado.
*SPE1:	it's the middle of of it's a wee a wee house the middle of it is straight up from the meado.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	on the left of the meadow yo-- the the far left the meadow straight up from ther.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	just above the wee bird.
*SPE1:	yeah above the wee birds uh-hu.
*SPE0:	right that's tha-- the-- right i know where you ar.
*SPE1:	and sight and eh the start of it is s-- straight across from the start writin.
*SPE0:	right that's i.
*SPE1:	s.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	that's that's where on my map i.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	so i just want to go up from ther.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	which side of the ruined monastery should i sort of be coming out at the right sid.
*SPE0:	oh have you got the ruined monaster.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	the ruined monastery'.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you should go up the right side and over over the top and down the lef.
*SPE1:	sort of ta-.
*SPE0:	but then stop once you're at the left side of i.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i go straight up round to the right over the top and down by the lef.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	and how far down so i'm just sort of where the writing is on the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	jus.
*SPE0:	yeah just about ther.
*SPE1:	right right i'm ther.
*SPE0:	are yo.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	we go w-- eh left right alon.
*SPE0:	'cause there's a lake just underneath that there's west lak.
*SPE0:	have you got tha.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	i've only got east lake i've not got west lak.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	we-- west lake is between the start and where you are and it's sort of a big circle and it's the b-- eh the the top of it's just just very just underneath the ruined monastery writin.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	so it's just a sort of big circl.
*SPE0:	so if you draw that i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	it starts just under the ruined monastery it goes to the star.
*SPE1:	and now what is i.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	it's it's sort o.
*SPE1:	what's thi.
*SPE1:	ne-- excuse m.
*SPE0:	it's above the start whereas the th-- what is it it's a sort of e.
*SPE0:	how can i describe the shap.
*SPE0:	it go so straight along the top straight straight down the right-hand sid.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	just along a wee bit then a diagonal line up so it's like a triangl.
*SPE1:	u.
*SPE0:	fo-- you could join the bottom of the lake with the start and the and the left-hand side of it to make a triangl.
*SPE1:	you join the the botto.
*SPE1:	oh see i've not got the bottom lak.
*SPE1:	the bottom lake's the start you sa.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	but it doesn't go right the way along to the start it stops about halfwa.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	i've got that roughl.
*SPE1:	and where's the next point in the triangle just under the ruined monaster.
*SPE0:	eh no wait a minut.
*SPE0:	what have you draw.
*SPE1:	i've got .
*SPE0:	a line along the to.
*SPE1:	a line right a straight line along the to.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	from from where i am sort of thin.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	it's not really straight but it's but it's easier to draw it straigh.
*SPE1:	o.
*SPE1:	right uh-hu.
*SPE1:	right i've got tha.
*SPE0:	the.
*SPE0:	straight line down the right-hand sid.
*SPE1:	eh to just the start bit down from down from where where's it start going down from the stile or from the start or wha.
*SPE0:	eh it's going down towards the star.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	straight down or sort of diagonally down towards i.
*SPE0:	sort of s-- straight dow.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	and the other one's sort o.
*SPE0:	it goes about three centimetres towards uh it stops at the start you kno.
*SPE1:	uh-huh s-- righ.
*SPE0:	in line with it it goes about three centimetres towards i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then goes up in a diagonal line for about five six centimetre.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE0:	it g-- and then it joins with the start i-- it joins with the to.
*SPE1:	right okay f-.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	five fi-.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i've got the sort of basic shape anyway so i should be able to a-- avoid i.
*SPE0:	avoid i.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	that's west lak.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	you're currently stopped in line with the ruined monastery wordin.
*SPE1:	i should be above i should be slightly above the lake then am .
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	uh-huh righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you go left along 'til you're in line with the left-hand side of the stil.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	then go up and over the top the stile and stop ther.
*SPE1:	straight up over the stil.
*SPE0:	straight u.
*SPE0:	and eh.
*SPE0:	as soon as you reach the top the stile turn right and go along 'til you reach the end i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i'm over the stile i've turn right 'til i reach the end of the stil.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	so that's just sort of a few centimetre.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	then you sto.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you go n-- go north for about three centimetre.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then go along for about one centimetre one or two i'd say tw.
*SPE1:	so i'm at the bo-- i'm sort of at the left-hand bottom of the popular tourist spot castle thin.
*SPE1:	or have you not got tha.
*SPE0:	i don't have tha.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	it says great viewpoin.
*SPE0:	it's miles away from that wha-.
*SPE0:	there's w-- a great viewpoin.
*SPE1:	yeah great viewpoint's awa-- quite a bit above i.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	and to the left yea.
*SPE0:	yeah you should be ther.
*SPE1:	so righ.
*SPE1:	i'm i'm ther.
*SPE1:	is there any hazards round about here the.
*SPE0:	then you go alon.
*SPE0:	eh no there's nothing on my ma.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	so go about two centimetres alon.
*SPE1:	eh to my righ.
*SPE0:	to your righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	then take a diagonal route dow.
*SPE0:	have you got the dead tree marke.
*SPE1:	the dutch el.
*SPE0:	it says dead tre.
*SPE1:	is it er underneath the rocket launch pad at your righ.
*SPE0:	e.
*SPE0:	i don't have a l-- a rocket launch pa.
*SPE1:	right wel.
*SPE1:	underneath the e-.
*SPE1:	e-- don't have east lake either do yo.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE0:	yeah i've got the east lak.
*SPE1:	sort of right well it's just sort of ten centimetres down from the right-hand side of the east lak.
*SPE1:	is that righ.
*SPE0:	oh i don't have tha.
*SPE1:	ah my my east lake's top hand right corne.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	that's where i've got the lak.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and there's a great viewpoint just underneath i.
*SPE0:	have you got tha.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	i've my great viewpoint's the the opposite corne.
*SPE0:	oh i've got two v-- great viewpoint.
*SPE1:	ah right i se.
*SPE0:	right so i've got a great viewpoint just underneath the lak.
*SPE1:	s-.
*SPE0:	but the-- there's a tree it's sort of black and wee branches it's g-- it's oh it's dead it's got no leaves on i.
*SPE1:	yeah i don't i don't hav.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i don't have it in the same place i've got one underneath east lake sort of ten centimetres down s.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	that's where mine i.
*SPE1:	oh righ.
*SPE1:	it's underneath the east lake about ten centimetres down from i.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm i'm i'm pos-- right i'm now sort of above the stile to the righ.
*SPE1:	so where where from her.
*SPE0:	you're above the stile to the righ.
*SPE0:	did you you you went along to the stile and then you went u.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	i went eh along i went along to the right-hand side the stile like you said then went up sort of a few centimetres and along slightly again to the righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you take a diagonal line down 'til you're underneath the tre.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	just straight diagonal dow.
*SPE1:	i don't know if i should sort of avoid this popular tourist spot or go to it or what you see i'm not eh i'm not sure if the idea is to have a tremendous holiday o.
*SPE0:	i don't kno.
*SPE1:	if the tourist spot's a trap or wha.
*SPE1:	right i'll just i'll just go alon.
*SPE1:	down so i'm right underneath the tre.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you go around go round the right-hand side of the tree 'til you're at the top of i.
*SPE1:	is it right on top of the tree or just at the right-hand side at the to.
*SPE0:	go round the right-hand side the tre.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and then go along along the the top 'til you're right above i.
*SPE1:	right i'm right above i.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	take a diagonal line up about two centimetres on quite a steep angl.
*SPE1:	eh to the left or righ.
*SPE0:	to the lef.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	the.
*SPE0:	go straight up to the bottom of the lak.
*SPE1:	right wel.
*SPE1:	i've got a rocket launch pad there which i'll sort of sideste.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	so i want to be right underneath the bottom of the lak.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	on the sort of right-hand side of the lak.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	you're about three three centimetres from the right-hand side of the lak.
*SPE1:	oh i shouldn't actually be a-- below the lake n.
*SPE0:	you're about three centimetres from the right hand side of the lak.
*SPE1:	oh righ.
*SPE1:	uh-huh that's right i'.
*SPE0:	towards the left-hand sid.
*SPE1:	yeah yeah that's where i am yea.
*SPE1:	so i just want to go up so i'm underneath the lak.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	and and the same sort of positio.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	your lake see the wee bit of the lake know the bottom of the lake stops then it goes up a wee bit before it goes a diagona.
*SPE1:	ehm y-- yeah uh-hu.
*SPE0:	do you see tha.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go straight along the bottom of the lake following it 'til you reach there and then go about two centimetres further and that's the finis.
*SPE1:	right so i want t.
*SPE1:	there's the bottom the bottom right of the lak.
*SPE1:	so in other words i want to sort of follow the shape of the lak.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	follow the shape of the lake until you y-- until like you reach th.
*SPE1:	the sort of diagonal bit near the en.
*SPE0:	'til you reach the end of the bo-.
*SPE0:	know the bottom sort of slopes up and then there's a sharp there's er about a ninety degree angle and it goes nort.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you want to go along to about there and then go another two centimetres following the same lin.
*SPE1:	so i want to go to the the bottom right-hand corner of the lake to start wit.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm at the bottom right-hand corner of the lake no.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go it's d-- eh go just about a couple of centimetres past tha.
*SPE1:	eh ab-- abo-- up or to the sid.
*SPE0:	just on the same a-- the same same wa.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	the same way as the lake goe.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	y-.
*SPE0:	the same way you were travelin.
*SPE1:	oh e.
*SPE1:	well y-- you don't really know which way i'm traveling i'm sort of traveling i if i was doing it the way i'm traveling i'd be going off to the righ.
*SPE1:	you want me to go up or to the right or wha.
*SPE0:	hm.
*SPE1:	eh.
*SPE1:	well i'm at the bottom of the lak.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	the bottom right-hand corner of the lak.
*SPE1:	do you want me to go two centimetres to the right or do you want me to go u.
*SPE0:	oh n.
*SPE0:	you're supposed to be at the bottom left-hand side of the lak.
*SPE1:	oh the bottom left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	oh right i see wh-- i see what you're doing a bit better now righ.
*SPE1:	i hopefully allowed to scrub that ou.
*SPE1:	so i want to go to the bottom oh right sorry there was a bit of .
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	it was my mistake i didn't realise you were saying bottom right-han.
*SPE1:	don't know what the what the wha-- what the psychologists'll take from that i don't know right from my left perhap.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm i'm there i'm at the botto.
*SPE1:	so i want to just go up same way the lake's going about two centimetre.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	you want go same way you're travelin.
*SPE1:	uh-huh righ.
*SPE0:	just beyond the beyond the bottom of the lake for about two centimetres and that's the finis.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	it it should be directly under the left-hand side of the lak.
*SPE1:	right i know where you ar.
