*SPE0:	you got an extinct volcan.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you got a cross above i.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	star.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you have got a tribal settlement down at the left-hand side of your pag.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	what you're going to do is you're going to from the start you're going to go left and you're going to go down down you know like you're going to go across a bit and down to the bottom of the extinct volcan.
*SPE0:	know what i mea.
*SPE1:	acros.
*SPE1:	have you got the machet.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	oh righ.
*SPE1:	have you got the rope bridg.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	where do i go across t.
*SPE0:	right you're just heading down to the left diagonally down to the bottom of the extinct volcano 'til you're about a centimetre left of the "e" in extinct volcan.
*SPE1:	a.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	see your "e.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go along about a centimetre and draw a do.
*SPE1:	to the lef.
*SPE0:	uh-huh to the lef.
*SPE1:	above the "e.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	oh righ.
*SPE0:	b-- just d-- st-- across from the "e.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	just a centimetre and draw a do.
*SPE0:	just about a centimetre and a hal.
*SPE0:	and draw from your start draw a line from your start down to that do.
*SPE1:	down to i.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	diagonally dow.
*SPE1:	not across to i.
*SPE0:	well it's kind of down 'cause your start's above the extinct volcan.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	so you've drawn a line down to th-- ther.
*SPE1:	to wher.
*SPE0:	to that dot that i've just given you about a centimetre from the extinct volcan.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	oh righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	what to the left of the "e.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	oh right oka.
*SPE0:	so you're going down that way and right keep on going down 'til you're about three centimetres from the bottom of the pag.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	so i'm in a diagonal at the momen.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	you're to go down like diagonall.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	and we're past we don't go through the old volcano n.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	you're just going down the side of the volcano until you're level with the the extinc.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	diagonally go down towards the left about another two centimetres continue your line for about another two centimetre.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	dow.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	so lik.
*SPE0:	then st-.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	so you're getting towards the bottom of the pag.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	now sto.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	now you you sh-- you should be about two or three centimetres from the bottom of the pag.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	y-- on my map i've got a tribal settlement along to the left towards the left-hand side of the pag.
*SPE1:	no i haven'.
*SPE0:	and what you're going to do is draw a straight line to the lef.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	until you're about three centimetres from the left-hand side of the pag.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	okay so just draw a straight lin.
*SPE1:	until you're about three centimetre.
*SPE0:	centimetres from the left-hand side of the page to your left oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	then sto.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see your rope bridg.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	you're now going to go up the pag.
*SPE0:	towards your rope bridge and you're going to cross the rope bridg.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	okay so go s-.
*SPE1:	so do i go straight up the.
*SPE0:	uh-huh just go straight u.
*SPE0:	and veer off to the right to the rope bridg.
*SPE0:	you know how you've the rope bridg.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	j-- just just go up as though you're going t.
*SPE1:	oh righ.
*SPE1:	just doing a diagonal again towards i.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	just you're just going up towards your rope bridg.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	and cross i.
*SPE1:	and cross i.
*SPE0:	and cross i.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	now you're at the right-hand side of your rope bridg.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	now can you go diagonally down right for about two centimetres just like diagonally down right not straight dow.
*SPE1:	oh right oka.
*SPE0:	but just diagonally down righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	for two centimetre.
*SPE0:	for two centimetre.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	and sto.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then you're going to keep on going right but you're going to go straight for about six centimetre.
*SPE0:	have you got a collapsed shelte.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	just under the "o" of the collapsed shelter you're going straight righ.
*SPE1:	oh right so oh righ.
*SPE0:	until you're underneath the "o" of the collapsed shelter you're about th-- two centimetres below the "o" of the collapsed shelter actuall.
*SPE1:	is there not a squiggly line ther.
*SPE1:	'cause i've got a machete in between the rope bridge and the collapsed shelter i couldn't go straight acros.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	that's why you're going dow.
*SPE1:	oh right oka.
*SPE0:	see i've taken you down diagonally right and then now you're going straight across righ.
*SPE1:	oh oka.
*SPE0:	see what i mea.
*SPE1:	oh no n.
*SPE0:	right you've just crossed the rope bridg.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and instead of going straight across to the collapsed shelte.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	i'm taking you down right and then acros.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	okay i'm taking you down a wee bit down a wee "u" shap.
*SPE1:	is it not a couple of inche.
*SPE0:	aye it's a couple of inches across to the collapsed shelte.
*SPE0:	but you're only going down about a couple of er you're only going down about an inc.
*SPE1:	i'm going down more than tha.
*SPE0:	well don't go d-.
*SPE0:	just go dow.
*SPE1:	i think it'll be thing with the machete i think it'll be out of i.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	then you've gone along righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	until you're abou.
*SPE1:	to the "o" of the collapsed shelte.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	but you're down a-- below the "o.
*SPE1:	uh-huh okay righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	i'll draw in tha.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	now i want you to go right through the "o" of the collapsed shelte.
*SPE1:	right through i.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	well you know what i mean you know as though you're going up that wa.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	and i want you to go up there for about three inche.
*SPE1:	what am i oh right am i actually going through the letter "o.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	okay righ.
*SPE0:	so i know exactly where you ar.
*SPE1:	okay righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	go through the "o" of the collapsed shelte.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and go u.
*SPE0:	have you got a saxon barn to your left hand sid.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	right i want you to go up straight up the pag.
*SPE1:	mmhmm oka.
*SPE0:	until you're ehm horizontally opposite the top of the saxon bar.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	and now you now you're up her.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	now i want you to right you're going to v-.
*SPE0:	see at the "n" of the saxon bar.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	right if you want to draw a dot ther.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	that's where you're heading-.
*SPE1:	below it directly below i.
*SPE0:	directly below i.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	that's where you want to head fo.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	but you're going to d-- go d-- like diagonally to i.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	but i want you to go up a tiny wee bit first then go down diagonally to i.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	'cause i've got a crevasse ther.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	so it's like a wee hum.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	a-.
*SPE1:	it's just a like is it a kind of curvy hum.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	okay the.
*SPE0:	you're going up and then you're going down just to underneath this point "n.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	underneath the saxon bar.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	that'll probably miss your crevass.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	right you're underneath the "n" of the saxon barn no.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	just underline saxon barn to the le-- go t-- left until you're underneath the "s.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	right have you got a group of pelican.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	right if you think see between this thi-- see how the saxon barn and the rope bridge are above each othe.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	well to the left i've got a bunch of pelican.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	so do you see what i'm going t.
*SPE0:	you've got the white mountain up above the saxon bar.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	well what we're going to do is we're going down and we're doing a "u" shape to miss these pelican.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	so what you're doing is you'r.
*SPE1:	are they in a straight are they like horizontal to the saxon bar.
*SPE0:	are there they're horizontal to the saxon bar.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	but they're they're th-- they're they're they're down a bit they're in between the saxon barn and the rope bridge if you can think about i.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	see to like to make a triangle see the point of the triangl.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	if you make a triangle from saxon barn to rope bridge at the point and that's where the pelicans ar.
*SPE0:	see if you join the rope bridge and the saxon barn togethe.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and then like you make a triangle out of i.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	that's where the pelicans ar.
*SPE1:	okay right oka.
*SPE0:	so you want to draw a "u" shape underneath these pelican.
*SPE1:	do yo.
*SPE0:	so see from where you are at the saxon bar.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	if you go down diagonally left about about an inch and a hal.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	and then you go along for about an inc.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and then we're going to go straight up to the white mountai.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	okay so you've made a kind of "u" shap.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	to miss these pelican.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go straight up 'til you're at the bottom of the white mountai.
*SPE1:	okay uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and right and see how the white mountain goes up diagonally righ.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	pretend you're climbing the top of the white mountai.
*SPE0:	so you're climbing up t.
*SPE1:	uu-u.
*SPE0:	oh you're climbing up to the top of the white mountai.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	jus.
*SPE0:	right up t-- up to the wee pea.
*SPE1:	all right just follow it the.
*SPE0:	ay.
*SPE0:	just follow the the rout.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	as though you're at now you're at the peak of the white mountai.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	have you got a golden beac.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE1:	oh yeah i have uh-huh sorr.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go straight up as though you're heading for that big rock at the golden beac.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	see the l-- rock at the right of this big black thin.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm u.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE0:	just a wee bit below that rock and sto.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	now we're goin.
*SPE1:	oop.
*SPE0:	completely rou-- we're going right now to the towards the slate mountai.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	so go right until you're at the bottom of the slate mountai.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	what in a straight line you mea.
*SPE0:	it's just a straight line righ.
*SPE1:	oh so i i go up further the.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	you're just you're just at the golden beac.
*SPE1:	where's your golden beach on your righ.
*SPE0:	and i'l.
*SPE0:	just at the lef.
*SPE1:	oh mine's on the righ.
*SPE0:	ah righ.
*SPE0:	but you you're y-- right okay you've got to the f-- top of the white mountai.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	right i wanted you to go straight u.
*SPE1:	okay i'll go straight u.
*SPE1:	how lo-- how fa.
*SPE0:	ehm about three inche.
*SPE1:	okay right got yo.
*SPE0:	just no i d-- i'll tell you wha.
*SPE0:	see your slate mountai.
*SPE0:	you're going straight up until you're just parallel with the slate mountai.
*SPE0:	you know and bu-- sorr.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	see the bottom of the slate mountai.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	that's as far as i want you to go which is about three inches along to the lef.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	then i want you to go alon.
*SPE1:	o.
*SPE0:	to the right three inches 'til you're at the bottom of your slate mountai.
*SPE1:	is that three inch-.
*SPE1:	oh i suppose s.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	you know what i mea.
*SPE0:	it's about three inche.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	now you're at the bottom of your slate mountai.
*SPE1:	uh-huh uh-hu.
*SPE0:	right climb your slate mountai.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	and come back down missing the seagull.
*SPE1:	oka.

*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and i want you to come back the way you came to the left underneath the slate mountai.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	until you're at the bottom left-hand side again but this time you're down below i.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	then have you got a secret valle.

*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	you've done tha.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and then go along right as though you're underlining the secret valle.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	and see just about a centimetre from the "y.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	aron-- along to your righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	that's the cross and that's the finis.
*SPE1:	is i.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	is that i.
*SPE0:	that's i.
*SPE1:	just a centimetre from the "y" on the righ.
