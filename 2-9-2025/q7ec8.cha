*SPE0:	you done this one befor.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	oh supe.
*SPE0:	you'll have no chape.
*SPE0:	okay "a" "q" "7" "c" "8" plus minus "4" "u" davi.
*SPE1:	and mar.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you've got the start poin.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	up high on the left-hand side yea.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	eh you got a haystac.
*SPE1:	just ther.
*SPE0:	just below i.
*SPE1:	to the right to lef.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	take a curve wel.
*SPE0:	you know where the c-- er the carpenter's house i.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	well take about a couple of inches well about an inch a couple of inches just just below the start of it do a curve which just about meets the haystack and eh goes to just eh directly below a level with jus-- just below level with the start eh the carpenter's hous.
*SPE1:	so you go if i curve from the start round t.
*SPE0:	so you're doing it's like .
*SPE0:	it's lik.
*SPE1:	just along an.
*SPE0:	a backwards "c.
*SPE1:	m.
*SPE0:	just beside the haystack meets the haystack just about about half a centimetre from the haystack and comes out to below the start line just below the level of the carpenter's hous.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you've go.
*SPE1:	you got th.
*SPE0:	directly below the star.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	then you've got about half a centimetre below the carpenter's hous.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	you've got that point do you want to mark a point ther.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	there'.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and you go from the star.
*SPE1:	so you'v.
*SPE0:	so about yo.
*SPE1:	carpenter house fro.
*SPE0:	start and you do a curve about half a centimetre from the haystack down to the poin.
*SPE1:	down to the point just at the side of the carpenter's hous.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	so just curving round down it like tha.
*SPE0:	just under the star.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	it's just under the start the point just under start and just under carpenter's hous.
*SPE1:	o.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	so you're it's it's going just it's eventually going to end up just below the start line but it's half a centimetre under the carpenter's hous.
*SPE1:	half a centimetre under the carpenter's house righ.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE1:	so we're down below the carpenter's house about half a centimetr.
*SPE0:	on the leve.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	but across below the star.
*SPE0:	see what i mea.
*SPE1:	oh away round here below the star.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	so it's that's the level you're going t.
*SPE1:	ah righ.
*SPE1:	so it sort of curves round like that backwards "c" as you've sai.
*SPE0:	it's no.
*SPE0:	it's just to the le-- it's to the left of the haystack it's just a really shallow thin.
*SPE1:	doesn't sound like what i've go.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you sti-.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	we'll start again the.
*SPE0:	you've got the start line righ.
*SPE1:	this is a good on.
*SPE0:	and you've e.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	you're going to end up directly below the start lin.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	so down belo.
*SPE0:	down below start lin.
*SPE1:	m.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	you want t.
*SPE0:	the point below the start line is level with about half a centimetre below the carpenter's hous.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	so you've got about half a centimetre below the carpenter's house draw a line across to below the start lin.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	drawn that i.
*SPE1:	it's acros.
*SPE0:	well don't draw a line draw a point there sorr.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	and you want t.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i've starte.
*SPE1:	so from the start i'm going what directio.
*SPE0:	you're going down towards the haystac.
*SPE1:	down towards the haystac.
*SPE0:	and you're missing the l-- haystack on the left by about half a centimetr.
*SPE1:	on the lef.
*SPE1:	on the lef.
*SPE0:	on the left of the haystack yea.
*SPE1:	so i'm coming down past the lef.
*SPE0:	uh it's it's just a shallo.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	a shallow curve to that point down ther.
*SPE1:	uh-huh right oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you want to go about an an inch to the right towards the carpenter's hous.
*SPE1:	an inch to the right righ.
*SPE0:	and then you want to go u.
*SPE1:	u.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	you want eh green ba.
*SPE0:	have you got green bay no right at the to.
*SPE1:	green ba.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	well you want to go u.
*SPE1:	so you're going up p-- on the right-hand side of the hi-- haystac.
*SPE0:	yeah you're d-- well let me see i'll tell you in a minut.
*SPE0:	see the carpenter's hous.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	you've got the left-hand side of the roo.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	well you've got about an inch from the top of that just less than an inc.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and you mark a point ther.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and join up the two point.
*SPE1:	so you've gone th-- start down to shallow curve round the haystack and along to that poin.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	that's directly below the star.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	below the s-- directly below the star.
*SPE0:	m.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	from the beginning agai.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	i think you're murdere.
*SPE0:	you're going directly below the start but you're taking a curve that just misses the haystac.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	it's just a really really sh-- shallow curv.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	right you've got tha.
*SPE1:	you're going so you're going d-- you're going down your star-- your starting poin.
*SPE0:	you've got that i.
*SPE0:	you're going starting dow.
*SPE1:	you just go down curve round the bottom of the haystac.
*SPE0:	and then you curve round the other way and you come to the bottom jus-.
*SPE1:	and you you come to the the roof a point where the roof of the carpenter's house left-hand sid.
*SPE1:	an inch above i.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	from the start you're starting directly below the start point is where you want to go that well make that the first mov.
*SPE0:	you got that you got that it's shallow curv.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	shallow curve i've go.
*SPE1:	i go down just and curve round the haystac.
*SPE0:	well not roun.
*SPE0:	you want to finish below the starting point you go down you curve past you curve past the haystac.
*SPE1:	so just a we.
*SPE0:	it's like a an inverted "c.
*SPE1:	so i'm curving back lik.
*SPE0:	it's like a "c" the wrong way roun.
*SPE1:	well i'm just curving back i.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	you're coming round to besi-- to below the start point which is also on a level below the carpenter's house that's to tell you where to sto.
*SPE1:	all righ.
*SPE1:	so i'm actually i'm starting here and i'm finishin.
*SPE0:	directly below star.
*SPE1:	so it's just a wee shallow curv.
*SPE0:	ay.
*SPE1:	well i'll have to miss the blacksmith i've got a blacksmith's right okay that'.
*SPE0:	that's yo.
*SPE0:	okay so you should just be about half a centimetre below the carpenter's house righ.
*SPE1:	a lot of rubbing scribbling going on her.
*SPE0:	so you're half a centimetre below the carpenter's house you're on that leve.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	so you come across an inch from that poin.
*SPE1:	to the righ.
*SPE0:	to the righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and that's about an inch from the carpenter's house as wel.
*SPE1:	se.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	a wee bit furthe.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	you've got that point in then ye.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	so you want to go u.
*SPE0:	you see the carpenter's house the roof the left-hand point of the roo.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	so i want to go up t.
*SPE0:	so you want to go u.
*SPE0:	there's an inch above there right just maybe a bit less than an inc.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	right so a-.
*SPE0:	and you want to join that point those two points up and that's in a sort of thirty thirty degree angle or something like tha.
*SPE1:	so it's a sort of diagona.
*SPE1:	right okay i'll jus.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	just take it across about one two two inches it's slightly below and easter.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	so one easter and we're goin.
*SPE0:	slightly below it two inches slightly below east it's about like ninety five degree.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and you've got the seven beeche.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	see you're about an inch above the seven beeches and about an inch to the left of the seven beeches that righ.
*SPE1:	no i'm not an inch above the.
*SPE1:	to the carpent-- the carpenter's house an inch above the c-- top left corner is is on a level with that the top of the seven beeches so now i've gone dow.
*SPE0:	not an inch above the.
*SPE0:	well you want to be about call it half an inch above the seven beeche.
*SPE1:	right so i'll jus.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	and from that point there you want to go about it's just off south to below the "s" in seven beeche.
*SPE1:	just off sout.
*SPE0:	it's southeast you want to be going right just below the "s.
*SPE1:	southeast mmhm.
*SPE1:	right down that way just below the "s" wait a minut.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	just below the "s.
*SPE0:	now e.
*SPE0:	you've got reclaimed fields down below tha.
*SPE1:	yeah i hav.
*SPE0:	down belo.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	in between the seven beeches and the reclaimed fields i've got a chape.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	mm righ.
*SPE1:	i don't have tha.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	eh what i need to do is i need to go round it again an inverted "c" well it's no an inverted "c" it's li-- the other way about opposite "c.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and you need to go around it so e.
*SPE1:	so i sort of curve underneath seven beeches and round and then over to back to where i started fro.
*SPE0:	yeah so yo.
*SPE0:	the the actual point where you want to finish up is e.
*SPE0:	you see the the thick tree trunk on the right-hand side of the seven beeche.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	the the the furthest right on.
*SPE0:	so you want to finis.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	you want to finish about two inches below tha.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	hold on t.
*SPE0:	which is about h-- about a centimetre above the reclaimed field.
*SPE0:	does that make sense to yo.
*SPE1:	m.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	the reclaimed fields are quite a distance awa.
*SPE0:	miles below it yea.
*SPE1:	ay.
*SPE0:	well e.
*SPE0:	we'll call it just about two inches maybe a bit more call it two and a half inches below the tree trun.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and that's where you e-- want to finish u.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	so to do that you'll need to take from the "s" and go round like from twelve o'clock to three o'cloc.
*SPE1:	yeah aroun.
*SPE0:	and go out an inc.
*SPE1:	and the.
*SPE1:	and then back in agai.
*SPE0:	from the "s.
*SPE0:	and then back into that point i told yo.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	got tha.
*SPE0:	s-- no.
*SPE0:	you want to go like the end of a test tube like that way you want to go round the reclaimed fields like tha.
*SPE0:	have you got crane ba.
*SPE1:	crane bay yea.
*SPE0:	you see the m-- the most northerly tip above the "b.
*SPE1:	over the right yea.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	you want to come round the test round the reclaimed fields and the test tube sh-- sort of shape to about oh i don't know about an inch and a half above the "b.
*SPE1:	an inc.
*SPE1:	above the "b.
*SPE0:	above the "b" yea.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE1:	so the point righ.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	above the point sorr.
*SPE0:	above the ti.
*SPE1:	have you got whitewashed cottag.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	so i'll have to miss tha.
*SPE1:	s.
*SPE1:	if i come round in my curve and then i'm going along and then curving back round the same wa.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	so the shape will be you'll be going east and then you'll be going dow.
*SPE1:	a kind of inverted in a "s" a backwards "s.
*SPE0:	it's no.
*SPE0:	well prob-.
*SPE1:	sort o.
*SPE0:	it's just like that shape you want to do so you're going east and then you're going that curve and then you're going west until you're above tha.
*SPE0:	ti.
*SPE1:	ah wel.
*SPE1:	the whole thing in together like from the seven beeches round it's like an "c" and then and it's like a normal "c" sort o.
*SPE1:	right i'll try and an inch and a half above there i'll have to draw it a bit s-- squin.
*SPE1:	so i'm so i'm coming down on the right-hand the left-hand side of the reclaimed field.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	and i've sort of s-- curved round to about ther.
*SPE0:	so you've got you've gone round the reclaimed field.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and you're about an inch and a half above the tip the northern-most ti.
*SPE1:	yeah about an inc.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	you want to go south down to that northern-most ti.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	just off to the left-hand side of i.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and you want to follow the contours of the bay round to the firs.
*SPE0:	well you know how it it sort of goes down in a curv.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and then you get a southern a dead south it goes almost due sout.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	well you want to follow the contours round to that poin.
*SPE1:	just skirt it alon.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm just ready to go sout.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	so no.
*SPE0:	have you got vast meadow and attractive cliff really clos.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	i've got attractive cliffs which are roun.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	well you want to g.
*SPE0:	see where it goes di-- due sout.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and then it almost goes due wes.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	well you want to do a straight line about a centimetre you want yeah you've got that point come down the due south and come across the wes.
*SPE1:	so skirting skirting alon.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	no e.
*SPE1:	just straight lin.
*SPE0:	just a cen-- you want to do a centimetre above d-- the western-most tip right and draw a straight line from where you've stopped no.
*SPE0:	you know when y-.
*SPE1:	uh-huh so it's righ.
*SPE1:	so it's just like a straight line from the south that bit there where it goes due south to about a centimetre abov.
*SPE0:	that's righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	so it's about that sort of angl.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	you want to go due west until you're above the "a" in attractive cliff.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then take it down about about the same angle as you took from the south to the west ti.
*SPE0:	take that down to the bottom just on the same level as attractive cliffs so you're doing down that angle and it's about an inch long shall we sa.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	right you got tha.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	in here you've got something to miss out haven't yo.
*SPE1:	crashed spaceshi.
*SPE0:	crashed spaceshi.
*SPE0:	so you want to go west of the crashed space the crashed spaceshi.
*SPE1:	right over to its wes.
*SPE0:	you want over to its wes.
*SPE1:	almost to the edge of the pape.
*SPE0:	yeah down the edge of the pape.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	just just past i.
*SPE0:	to jus.
*SPE0:	to the level of a chestnut tre.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	when you get to chestnut tree curve round and go to about half an inch from the bottom of the chestnut tre.
*SPE1:	to.
*SPE1:	half an inch from the botto.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i curve round oh so i'm on its left-hand side and i'm out about half an inch bef-- botto.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	you go up about half the trunk of the chestnut tree to the dimple in the chestnut tre.
*SPE0:	you see the dimple in the chestnut tre.
*SPE1:	the dimple u.
*SPE0:	halfway up the trunk just before th.
*SPE1:	ay.
*SPE0:	the branches star.
*SPE1:	the branche.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	you've got that's only about like a centimetre lon.
*SPE1:	s.
*SPE0:	and that's your finish poin.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	so i've taken my cur-- i've gone down past spaceship i've curved round to a poin.
*SPE0:	about half an inc.
*SPE1:	abov.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	you're you're half an inch from the base of the tre.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	and you s-- then you go due nort.
*SPE1:	oh righ.
*SPE1:	i've go to the bo-- i go to the base of the tre.
*SPE0:	from there you c-- half an inch from the base of the tree and then you go north half a way up the the tree trun.
*SPE1:	curve aroun.
*SPE0:	all the way up the tree trunk basically to the stop at th.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	and that's it ther.
*SPE0:	and that's your finis.
*SPE0:	so your the finish point should be level with where the branches star.
*SPE1:	uh-huh righ.
*SPE0:	that righ.
*SPE0:	i think we got that wee bit in a bit sh-- stramas.
*SPE1:	i know aye star.
