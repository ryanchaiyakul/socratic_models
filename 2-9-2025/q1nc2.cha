*SPE0:	e.
*SPE0:	no n.
*SPE0:	wait a mi-- wait a minut.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE1:	above the site of the plane cras.
*SPE0:	yeah uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	your plane crash should be kind of down a wee bit towards the the line at the botto.
*SPE1:	nearer the bottom of the pag.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	how far up from the bottom of the pag.
*SPE0:	about righ.
*SPE0:	ther-- there should be about an inch in between the bottom of your page and your first line righ.
*SPE1:	right that's fin.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then your plane crash is just kind of above tha.
*SPE1:	oh just above tha.

*SPE1:	right after tha.
*SPE1:	m.
*SPE0:	'ka.
*SPE1:	and then you go up three inche.

*SPE1:	oh uh-huh n.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	where are yo.
*SPE1:	my inches must be different from yours 'cause i'm not even halfway across the pag.
*SPE1:	i should be away at the other s-- side of the pag.
*SPE0:	you should be kind of at the right-hand sid.
*SPE1:	how l-- how big's your pag.
*SPE0:	e.

*SPE1:	so where how far up the the right-hand side should it b.
*SPE0:	you shou-- you should b.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE1:	when i reach the right-hand side how f-- about halfwa.
*SPE0:	how how do you mea.
*SPE1:	er you told me to draw a line going alo-- over to the right-hand sid.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and you should be about two and a half inches fr-- from the right-hand side of the e-- edge of the pag.
*SPE1:	h-.
*SPE1:	two and a half inches on.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	two and a half righ.
*SPE1:	is it sort of just sloping upwards this lin.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	kind of gently sloping upward.
*SPE0:	and there's a savannah at the right-hand side of your line just no.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	there isn'.
*SPE0:	well wel.
*SPE0:	there is on min.
*SPE1:	there's there's there's a a savannah further dow.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE0:	well y-.
*SPE0:	you go pas.
*SPE1:	is the line about halfway up the page just no.
*SPE0:	no not quit.
*SPE1:	where ar.
*SPE0:	we're still we're still a bit nearer the botto.
*SPE1:	bu.
*SPE1:	oh righ.
*SPE0:	that that line shouldn't have been that long reall.
*SPE0:	but this this line carries up to about the centre of the page but you're still kind of at the right-hand side kind of vertical line u.
*SPE1:	whe.
*SPE0:	about eh.
*SPE1:	no.
*SPE1:	oh righ.
*SPE0:	yeah an.
*SPE1:	a vertical line u.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	maybe about another two and a half inche.
*SPE1:	so i should be f-- more than halfway up the page furthe.
*SPE0:	are you sh-.
*SPE0:	you should be about exactly halfway up the pag.
*SPE0:	and but you're still kind of at the right-hand sid.
*SPE1:	i kno.
*SPE1:	i'm at the i'm about two and a half inches off the right-hand sid.
*SPE0:	right that's fin.
*SPE1:	but i'm mm but i'm too high i think right doesn't matter jus.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE1:	that's me verticall.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then you go along left about an inch just a straight lin.
*SPE0:	and underneath there's a a slate mountai.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	i don't have a slate mountain i've got a white mountai.
*SPE0:	oh righ.
*SPE0:	ehm after you've gone along your inch you know you start going downwards towards the left eh.
*SPE1:	downwards toward.
*SPE0:	a kind of forty-five degree line about an inch and a half down kind of slopin.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and you should be more to the left-hand side of the page no.
*SPE1:	e.
*SPE0:	kind of just off centr.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	about i'm about centre never min.
*SPE0:	right that's oka.
*SPE0:	and just after you've gone down your slope do another short line about an inch to your left just a straight line alon.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and there's some hot wells above thi.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	no n.
*SPE1:	there's some hot springs below but never min.
*SPE0:	oh right er.
*SPE0:	now you should be about maybe two inches from the left-hand sid.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	where are yo.
*SPE1:	maybe three and a hal.
*SPE1:	three and a half inche.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	now we're going kind of down about another inc.
*SPE1:	am i meant to be a-- away over the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE1:	if i go down an inch i can't 'cause i'll go right through a hot spring i'll need to go further alon.
*SPE0:	o.
*SPE1:	i'll just take the line further along to the lef.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	right righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	wh-- tell me where are where you are no.
*SPE1:	halfway up the page a couple of inches off the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you seem to be kind of down a wee bit i think it doesn't matte.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	the line just goes straight up now kind of sloping towards the righ.
*SPE1:	oh grea.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE1:	through mm-hm.
*SPE0:	but it goes up quite far it goes up goes up to about eh.
*SPE1:	but this is not making sense because i'm just going to be doubling back on myself and there's no like obstacles or anything never min.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE1:	what have i to d.
*SPE0:	wait a minut.
*SPE0:	the line that that i've just done which kind of goes from the right-hand side to the left-hand side is kind of sloping downwards righ.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	i is i.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and that kind of g-- that kind of takes you to th-- to the left-hand side of the page righ.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and the line now should be going right up kind of a vertical lin.
*SPE1:	vertical lin.
*SPE0:	up quite high it'll go up to about the top third of the page sloping slightly at the end of your line to the righ.
*SPE1:	what so it's going up vertically and then slopin.
*SPE0:	sloping just at the en.
*SPE0:	at the right and you should be just about the top third of the pag.
*SPE1:	ehm n.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	i had to avoid a mountain s.
*SPE0:	oh is th-- is there a white mountain ther.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	yeah you should be kind o.
*SPE1:	what sh-- what side should i b.
*SPE0:	just at the left of tha.
*SPE1:	the left-hand side of i.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	yeah i've i've went round the left of tha.
*SPE0:	oh right okay wel.
*SPE1:	but i'm a bit high i thin.
*SPE0:	see the line should kind of slope towards the righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	level to the top of the mountai.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and then it should go straight up from there about an inch and a half just a straight line u.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	and is there any obstacles ther.
*SPE0:	no none on min.
*SPE1:	there is on mine there's round rock.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	right i'm going up i've done tha.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	now you should be about maybe an inch and a half from the top of the pag.
*SPE1:	yeah well righ.
*SPE0:	yeah righ.
*SPE1:	just make it a bit longe.
*SPE0:	and then we go about two inches straight along to your righ.
*SPE1:	is there any obstacles ther.
*SPE0:	mm n.
*SPE1:	right i've done tha.
*SPE0:	and then ehm just just to the right of this on mine th-- there's a lak.
*SPE1:	mmhmm that's righ.
*SPE0:	is that ther.
*SPE0:	well you you sh-- yo.
*SPE1:	it's about the first thing that ha.
*SPE0:	right an.
*SPE0:	you take your line right round the outside of the lak.
*SPE1:	the far righ.
*SPE1:	so i'm going u.
*SPE0:	so you're going u.
*SPE0:	roun.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	dow.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	just circle the lak.
*SPE0:	yeah just uh-hu.
*SPE0:	until you're kind of maybe half an inch down from the the left-hand side of the lak.
*SPE0:	see what i mea.
*SPE1:	mm i so i'm going vertically like the last i'm going round the lake and then taking it down half an inch past the lake taking the line pa-.
*SPE0:	well y-- ehm wait a wee minut.
*SPE0:	you don't quite take i.
*SPE0:	know where yours says lak.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	you don't quite take it right round up kind of goes straight alon.
*SPE1:	oh i se.
*SPE0:	see what i mea.
*SPE1:	ah well see my line's below well on parallel with the lake so i've had to take it up draw it up and then roun.
*SPE0:	uh-huh righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	that'll be alrigh.
*SPE1:	so then what do i d.

*SPE0:	do you have the.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	n.

*SPE0:	mine goes after you've taken your li-- rou-- line round it's kind of like a circle but it's it's not joine.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	it goes down mayb.
*SPE1:	oh it's nearly like a circle circling right roun.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	it but it's not joined there's about an inch between the two line.
*SPE1:	o.
*SPE1:	right what what do i do after tha.
*SPE0:	er.
*SPE0:	see where your your horizontal line at at the top stops just before you go round the lak.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	see if you just go directly down from that erm there should be a vertical line about two and a half inches just at at the beginning of the lak.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	you loop down about an inch below tha.
*SPE1:	and what abou.
*SPE0:	carry on your line down about two and a half inches just straight dow.
*SPE1:	where the lake starts wher.
