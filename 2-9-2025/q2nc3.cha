*SPE0:	have you got tha.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	erm now i want you to take a route about one inch directly wes.
*SPE0:	if the top of the page is north and the left-hand side of the page is wes.
*SPE0:	i want you to go about one inch wes.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	now e.
*SPE0:	we're heading about two inches southwes.
*SPE0:	eh which should leave you t-- at the bottom left-hand corner of the missionary camp about an inch diagonally away from i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	got yo.
*SPE0:	and then ab-- about an inch from the bottom of the page as wel.
*SPE1:	sure oka.
*SPE0:	now on your map on the left-hand bottom corner do you have a bunch of rather nasty looking gorilla.
*SPE1:	no i don'.
*SPE0:	well i do and i think it's something we might want to avoi.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	right so er.
*SPE0:	my route tells me to go on a slightly dipping downwards line west but don't draw it yet 'til i give you the exact instruction.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	this line is dipping slightly down and to the left keeping about well you'd be better to go to within about half an inch of the bottom of the page so at the bottom left-hand corner you should be about an inch from both the left-hand side and the bottom of the page a-- a half an inch from the a-.
*SPE0:	sorry i'll start that agai.
*SPE0:	should be an inch from the left-hand side of the page and half an inch from the bottom side of the page at the bottom left-hand corne.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	is this avoiding the banana tre.
*SPE0:	avoiding n.
*SPE0:	avoiding gorilla.
*SPE0:	have you got banana tre.
*SPE1:	i've got a banana tre.
*SPE1:	but it's probably in much the same plac.

*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE0:	so you're heading s-- s-- west but slightly southerl.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	stop about an inch from the left-hand side of the pag.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	should be at a point about half an inch off the bottom of the page no.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	now i think we should eh read the banana tree as where the gorillas live s.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	erm avoiding the banana tree i suppos.
*SPE0:	erm go abou.

*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	eh go across the rope bridge and just stop at the end of i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	go directly down half an inc.

*SPE1:	no sod al.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go up about four inches directly up so you're at the top right-hand side of the lost step.
*SPE1:	four inches directly up the side top right-hand sid.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	that's not directly up on min.
*SPE0:	alrigh.
*SPE0:	where are the lost steps in relation to the waterfal.
*SPE1:	they are about about seven inches awa.
*SPE0:	seven inche.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	well mine aren't slightly nearer mine are only about three inches awa.
*SPE1:	a.

*SPE0:	horizontally leve.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.

*SPE1:	s.
*SPE0:	just keep going in a straight line don't go into the curve yet until you get to the gazelle.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	and then curve round the gazelle.
