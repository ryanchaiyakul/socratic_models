*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	you're starting at the eh.
*SPE0:	left-hand side of the cliff.
*SPE1:	a-.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	i've got a start poin.
*SPE0:	right got start poin.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	oh you're going to do a backward "s.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	you're going to do a backward "s" yo.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you're going to go down slightly for about a centimetr.
*SPE1:	is this before or after the backward "s.
*SPE0:	this is before i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	i'm explaining how to do the backward "s.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	go downward.
*SPE1:	for about a centimetr.
*SPE0:	s-- for a centimetre righ.
*SPE0:	you're going to eh.
*SPE0:	follow ehm a line it's diagonal it's like a five o'clock lin.
*SPE0:	do you know what i'm talking abou.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	and you're going by this time you should be just at the left-hand side at bottom of the cliff.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	going to do a half circle you're going to do it towards the pag.
*SPE1:	towards the end of the pag.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	the opposite of an indifference curve if that's the way i could explain i.
*SPE1:	s.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	so eh.
*SPE1:	would that starting at the bottom of the cliffs a half circle towards the left-hand side of the pag.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	do you have a forg.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	you're going to do another circl.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	half circle it's as if you're going round somethin.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go round something imagine there's something there you're going to go round it you're going to head off towards the pag.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	do a half circle and see when you come to the point just at the end of that half circl.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	are you at i.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	head up in a diagonal lo-- line towards a one o'cloc.
*SPE0:	do you have an old pin.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	head up to the top of that old pin.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	now you're going to come down again at a slight slant just a slight slant right a slight slop.
*SPE1:	down on the l-- the left or the right-hand side of the pin.
*SPE0:	you're going to come down on the right-hand side of the pin.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	a slope towards the righ.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	you're going towards the pag.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	not coming off i.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	do you have a pine fores.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you're going to slope ehm down towards the pine pine forest but you're going to come closer closer to the pine forest when you're slopin.
*SPE0:	do you know what i mea.
*SPE0:	the gap between the path and the pine forest is getting smalle.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	and then you should be at the bottom of the pine fores.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you're going to do another half circle towards the towards the right you're going out of the page right another half circle out of the pag.
*SPE1:	a half circle to the righ.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	so the outer circle's like s-- ehm is right across from the edge of the page oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	do you have a baker.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	go down slightly from that half circle just very very slightl.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you're going to head off again towards the right and go right round that baker.
*SPE1:	all the way round i.
*SPE0:	all the way roun.
*SPE0:	are you at crane ba.
*SPE0:	like see the the first peak in great crane ba.
*SPE0:	are you opposite directly opposite f-- up from i.
*SPE1:	ehm not ye.
*SPE1:	but i will be in a minut.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	do tha.
*SPE1:	yeah righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	go straight down for about three centimetre.
*SPE0:	see you come to that ehm curve in the ba.
*SPE0:	you want to be about a centimetre away just from crane ba.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	follow that curve round 'til you come to the second pea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	are you at wheatfield.
*SPE1:	no d-.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	i don'.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	right you're going to head off towards a leftward ehm slant sloping down agai.
*SPE1:	how far dow.
*SPE0:	about three centimetre.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	go straight along for another three centimetre.
*SPE0:	to the lef.
*SPE1:	to the lef.
*SPE0:	are you above a rocket warehous.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you're going to slants go to the end of the rocket warehouse if you know what i mea.
*SPE0:	see how the to.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	of the rocket warehous.
*SPE0:	go to the end of tha.
*SPE1:	parallel to the the rocket warehous.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	slope s-- slope down again to the left directl.
*SPE1:	to directly to the left so t.
*SPE0:	directly t.
*SPE1:	to the lef.
*SPE0:	like you're sloping down like a seven o'clock lin.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	to the left of the rocket warehous.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	how far dow.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE0:	you should be about ehm six centimetres above the bottom of the pag.
*SPE1:	so below the rocket warehous.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	you're at the left-hand side of the ro-.
*SPE1:	s-- stop at the lef.
*SPE0:	you should be just an inch away from the edge of the page no.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	go straight down again for three centimetre.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and then curve towards the old lighthous.
*SPE1:	round which side of the cav.
*SPE0:	hmm i don't have a cav.
*SPE0:	ehm go towards the lighthous.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	ehm just slope towards i.
*SPE0:	slope towards i.
*SPE0:	you're forming another half circle agai.
*SPE1:	ehm a half circle toward.
*SPE0:	the l-- old lighthous.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and that's you once you get to the old lighthous.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	that's it finishe.
