*SPE1:	okay yea.
*SPE0:	right s.
*SPE0:	go er about two inches to your ehm to your left at a sort of a-- angl.
*SPE1:	two inches to the m.
*SPE0:	abou.
*SPE0:	your left a sort of angle about forty-five degree.
*SPE0:	to e.
*SPE1:	er.
*SPE1:	what's two inches sort abou.
*SPE0:	well it's two inche.
*SPE0:	i don't know actually e.
*SPE0:	er well ten centimetres then maybe sa.
*SPE1:	ten er to forty-five degrees slop.
*SPE0:	to the horizonta.
*SPE1:	have you got allotments to my right is i.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	it's different it's a different map eh.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	erm t-- it can't be to my left anyway 'cause that's off the page from the star.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	it's to my right so it must be to your lef.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	it's the map's turned round so it must be to my right as well if it's to your right it's to my righ.
*SPE0:	oh right sorr.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go to your right then ten centimetres to your righ.
*SPE1:	erm right along or to an angle did you sa.
*SPE0:	well .
*SPE0:	imagine there's like a ehm a line like horizonta.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	and then let's say f-- ph thirty degrees up the wa.
*SPE0:	so it's at an angl.
*SPE1:	up the wa.
*SPE1:	up the wa.
*SPE0:	so it's like an angle like tha.
*SPE1:	up the wa.
*SPE0:	oh dea.
*SPE1:	angled u.
*SPE1:	t-- do you have a lak.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	just above the start point righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	how does it go from ther.
*SPE0:	down below tha.
*SPE0:	down below tha.
*SPE0:	to about halfway down the middle of the lak.
*SPE1:	halfwa.
*SPE1:	what's that halfway wha.
*SPE0:	the b-- see where the bottom of the the bottom line of the lak.
*SPE1:	yeah e.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	to the right-hand side underneath i.
*SPE0:	uh-huh about .
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	about halfway under tha.
*SPE1:	halfway well never min.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see the bottom line of the lake righ.
*SPE1:	oh you mean halfway from just where i would be if i went across oh n.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see the bottom line of the lake righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	halfway along tha.
*SPE1:	halfway along oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE0:	the.
*SPE0:	straight dow.
*SPE1:	straight dow.
*SPE0:	abou.
*SPE0:	er maybe five centimetre.
*SPE1:	right i've got some allotments her.
*SPE1:	so does it go to your right again does it go righ.
*SPE0:	it sort of curves roun.
*SPE1:	curves round okay righ.
*SPE0:	and then the.
*SPE1:	along to your righ.
*SPE0:	it's like an "s" shape right but n-- not like a steep "s" shape like a sort of er sort of stretched out "s" shap.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	a wee bit ehm 'til you're about er halfway down the page when you get to the bottom curve that comes back out the wa.
*SPE1:	erm do i go along righ.
*SPE0:	and then you go to your lef.
*SPE1:	go to my lef.
*SPE0:	for about er five centimetre.
*SPE1:	is there an obstacle down at the bottom left-hand corner of your pag.
*SPE0:	er but you shouldn't be down ther.
*SPE0:	this is you're over on the right-hand side at the right-hand si-- half of your pag.
*SPE1:	erm wel.
*SPE1:	a we-- is it called the west lake the star.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	it's east lake at the start of min.
*SPE1:	o.
*SPE1:	i've got a start at the west lak.
*SPE1:	have we got the right map.
*SPE1:	bollock.
*SPE1:	o.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	well i don't have i don't know abou.
*SPE0:	are you over at the right-hand side how about halfway down the page at the momen.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	eas-- hold on start up at the east lak.
*SPE1:	where's the star.
*SPE0:	what do you want me to start agai.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	'cause i've got a start underneath the west lake so i'm a.
*SPE0:	oh do you know what i've been doing oh go.
*SPE1:	wha.
*SPE0:	i've i've started from the finish that's why i wasnae even looking at that i just saw the cross er righ.
*SPE0:	oops righ.
*SPE0:	so we should be at the bottom left-hand corner of the map here righ.
*SPE0:	i've went through the the other way round that's really stupid right e.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	okay righ.
*SPE0:	so the start's abou.
*SPE1:	you're at the west lak.
*SPE0:	the start's about a third of the way up the pag.
*SPE1:	yeah no it's all righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	i've got that marked o.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	and i've got west lake above i.
*SPE0:	well i've not got tha.
*SPE1:	just above to the righ.
*SPE0:	no wonder we're having problems ther.
*SPE0:	right so e.
*SPE0:	just sort of go to your lef.
*SPE1:	go to my lef.
*SPE0:	about a centimetr.
*SPE1:	oh w-- a centimetre right hold on right now a centimetre okay righ.
*SPE0:	and then go straight dow.
*SPE1:	straight dow.
*SPE1:	to where how lon.
*SPE0:	to about two centimetres from the bottom of the pag.
*SPE1:	two centimetres from the bottom of the page oka.
*SPE0:	then go to your right about eh five centimetre.
*SPE1:	ffffff.
*SPE1:	five centimetres righ.
*SPE0:	and then g.
*SPE1:	er ch do you have any an allotment.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	allotments yea.
*SPE1:	righ.

*SPE0:	if you go straight up the way you'll be hitting the allotments s.
*SPE1:	yeah right yea.
*SPE0:	well s-.
*SPE0:	just go straight up the way so you're a bit left of the allotment.
*SPE1:	just lef.
*SPE0:	up about half a centimetre ef-- lef.
*SPE1:	okay righ.
*SPE0:	and then like curve round the top of the allotment.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	and then go in an angle about say thirty degrees from th.
*SPE0:	say the allotments are the horizontal righ.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	go in an angle about thirty degrees up from tha.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	from the left-hand side of the or the right-hand side of the allotments above the right-hand sid.
*SPE0:	above the right-hand sid.
*SPE1:	thirty degree.
*SPE0:	roughl.
*SPE1:	thir-.
*SPE0:	and then say about ehm eh over to about two thirds of the way over the side of the page to the righ.
*SPE1:	erm do you have a flight museum anywher.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	erm what is it two thirds the way across the page an angle of thirty degrees oka.
*SPE1:	two thirds right should be about there yeah oka.
*SPE0:	and then you go straight up say about er to about halfway up the pag.
*SPE1:	halfway u.
*SPE1:	is there a disused monaster.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	there yea.
*SPE0:	so y-- right where you are at the moment's just like see where it says disused monastery righ.

*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE0:	over the top of i.
*SPE1:	over the to.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	round to m.
*SPE0:	round and then and then li-- when you're round the side of that a l-- a straight line to about er maybe ten centimetres out from the side the left-hand side of the pag.
*SPE1:	six centimetres righ.
*SPE1:	do you have an alpine garden just above yo.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE1:	how does it g.

*SPE1:	to the left oka.
*SPE0:	so and then you're up to the top of the alpine garde.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	and then you go to your right about er five centimetres mayb.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	and then straight u.
*SPE0:	have you got a youth hoste.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	whereabouts is the youth hoste.

*SPE1:	slightly to the right oka.
*SPE1:	directly above it how muc.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	where are you just no.
*SPE1:	erm about one centimetre from the side of the alpine garden that's above it and along on.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go along a wee bi.
*SPE0:	until see the "d" of the alpine garden on the in between the "d" of the see where it says alpine garde.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	just look at that the d-- in between the "d" and "e" just put a straight line straight above tha.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	okay righ.
*SPE0:	about er maybe ffffphhhhh ten centimetre.
*SPE1:	right ten centimetres oka.
*SPE1:	an.
*SPE0:	and then g-- go to your right about five centimetre.
*SPE1:	right five oka.

*SPE0:	no n.
*SPE0:	just to the top of the telephone bo.
*SPE0:	see where the top i.
*SPE1:	the top of the telephone bo.
*SPE0:	to level with tha.
*SPE1:	yeah oka.
*SPE0:	and then e.
*SPE0:	directions on er maybe north northwest for about e.
*SPE1:	northwes.
