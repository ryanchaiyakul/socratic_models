*SPE1:	m.
*SPE0:	and so you're going to pa-- you're going to pass by the graveyard as wel.
*SPE1:	m.
*SPE0:	and then you're going to go up and over the top of the f-- u.
*SPE0:	what i've got is a fast flowing rive.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	do you have you have your c-.
*SPE1:	fast running cree.
*SPE0:	fast running cree.
*SPE0:	where is that on a level with the diamond mine or is it slightly belo.
*SPE1:	it's just slightly abov.
*SPE0:	slightly abov.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	well i've got a fast flowing river her.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	what you'd best to do is go along past the bottom go along okay sorry go along to your right and veer slightly upwards as you reach the cree.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and then go over and round the creek to your righ.
*SPE0:	and then eh.
*SPE0:	do you have an apache cam.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see when you're over the top of the fast or your creek or the river that i've got here when you're over the top of that and in line vertically in line with the apache cam.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	go south until just above the apache cam.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	when you reach the apache cam.
*SPE0:	ehm do you have a walled cit.
*SPE1:	right away on the far lef.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	well you're going to go from above the apache camp to the walled city but you've got to avoid a carved wooden pol.
*SPE0:	which in my map is slightly above the level of the apache cam.
*SPE1:	no this is vertically in line with the walled city below i.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	okay s.
*SPE0:	right i've got one of them as wel.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	but there's another one a carved wooden pole here which is halfway between the walled city and the apache cam.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	but slightly above the level of the apache cam.
*SPE1:	s.
*SPE1:	i'd be better to go underneath i.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	so you've got so you're going from above the apache camp underneath the carved wooden pole and over the top of the walled cit.
*SPE0:	and then when you reach the far si-- yo-- your left-hand side of the walled city travel southwards until you come to the level of some flat rock.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and go bel-.
*SPE0:	do you have a stone cree.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	right s.
*SPE0:	what i want you to do is go between the flat rocks and the stone cree.
*SPE0:	but do you have anything between the walled city and the carved wooden pol.
*SPE1:	ghost tow.
*SPE0:	a ghost tow.
*SPE0:	so you're going t.
*SPE0:	that's not on my ma.
*SPE0:	you've got to avoid that i thin.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	so go south down past the walled city underneath your ghost town and then slightly up sort of northeast direction between the flat rocks and the stone cree.
*SPE1:	betwee.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE1:	it'd be better if i s-- s-- between the walled city and the ghost town no to go underneath it above i.
*SPE1:	or have you got something else ther.
*SPE0:	i've not got anything betw-- between the carved wooden pole and the walled cit.
*SPE0:	but the map shows a curve a "c"-shaped curv.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	score that ou.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and sort of and then slightly up underneath the flat rocks and above the stone cree.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	the.
*SPE0:	go slightly to your right beyond the flat rocks until you are above the level of the buffal.
*SPE1:	so i i'll be avoiding the saloon ba.
*SPE0:	i don't have a saloon bar her.
*SPE1:	i've got her.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	okay so avoid the saloon ba.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and ehm then right then eh.
*SPE0:	just straight down to the right of the buffal.
*SPE1:	to the righ.
*SPE0:	y-.
*SPE0:	so that so that you're on you're on the right of the buffal.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	and go underneath the buffal.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	do you have a cattle ranc.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	ehm do you have a for.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	so you're going to go from the buffalo to the fort but you've got to avoid the cattle ranch on the way and you'll have to go up and over the top of the cattle ranc.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	which on my map is halfway between the buffalo and the for.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	that on the the level between the fort m.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE0:	it's almost on level with the fort but it's slightly higher than the for.
*SPE1:	s.
*SPE0:	so you need to be go up on a sort of hil.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	over the cattle ranc.
*SPE0:	underneath buffalo or over the cattle ranc.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	then underneath the for.
*SPE1:	under the for.
*SPE0:	underneath the fort uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and come out at the left-hand side of the fort and finishing ehm not beside but on the same level as the the carved wooden pole the base of the carved woode-- wooden pol.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	okay that's you finishe.
*SPE1:	oka.
