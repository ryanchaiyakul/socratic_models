*SPE0:	do you see the collapsed shelte.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	right eh.
*SPE0:	if you start sloping upwards slightly towards the right 'til you're about parallel with the top of the collapsed shelter but still oh about an inch and a half from the left-hand side of the pag.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	so that should be about three and a half inche.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	so then start heading towards the right of the page ehm over the top of the collapsed shelter about three inche.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	ehm so you should be just at about the end of the collapsed shelte.
*SPE1:	ay.
*SPE0:	right so go down to just down the side of the the down the right-hand side of the collapsed shelter 'til you're equal with about the bottom of i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	do you see the savanna.
*SPE1:	ay.
*SPE0:	right eh.
*SPE0:	it should be about if you s-- a slight slope upwards to the bottom of the savannah it should be about three inche.
*SPE1:	ay.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	so if you just head up towards the bottom of the savanna.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	not underneath it thoug.

*SPE1:	aye righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and now go to the left about an inch just un-- so that you're going under the hot well.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	the.
*SPE0:	another sort of diagonal slope downwards but ehm slightly steeper than forty-five degree lin.
*SPE0:	forty-five degrees for about an inc.
*SPE1:	ay.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	then eh.
*SPE0:	do you see the white mountai.
*SPE1:	mmhm.

*SPE1:	right i think s.
*SPE1:	where is it i need to end up the left or the right side of the white mountai.
*SPE0:	ehm the lef.

*SPE0:	if you start heading towards the lake in a straight line about three in-- just about three inches 'til you get to the the edge of the lak.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	then you're going round the lake in a clockwise directio.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	but not right round i.
