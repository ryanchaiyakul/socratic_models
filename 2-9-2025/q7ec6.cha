*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	well on the the eastern side of the water bit yo.
*SPE0:	see where the water i.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	the water at the bottom of crest fall.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	at the to.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see how there's a bit of rock at the sides at the to.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	the rock.
*SPE0:	well o-- on the eastern sid.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	m.
*SPE0:	r-- oka.
*SPE0:	take the middle of the fall.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and go slightly to the eas.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and up about three quarters of an inc.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	that's the star.
*SPE0:	that's your start poin.
*SPE0:	you've got tha.
*SPE0:	i should have worked that out shouldn't .
*SPE1:	ay.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	do you have mm banana something ther.
*SPE1:	banana tre.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	i don'.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	come along from the start point to just come straight west to the edge of the falls above the where the edge it would start to come dow.
*SPE1:	seagull.
*SPE1:	seagulls ay.
*SPE0:	just past the seagull.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	come at a an angle of about a hundred and ninety-five degree.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	come down t.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you see the the middle line in the waterfall.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	the waterfall lin.
*SPE1:	see where it finishe.
*SPE0:	at the bottom of that lin.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	across from that i finished that line ther.
*SPE1:	got i.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and no.
*SPE0:	curve roun.
*SPE0:	ehm see where a-- to the bottom of the "c" of crest right you know where the "c" i.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	well maybe go two inches to the west of tha.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and put a point ther.
*SPE1:	got i.
*SPE0:	and draw a curve between these two point.
*SPE1:	what kind of curv.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE0:	a curved mainly to the the west so very shallow curve right not straight down then curve round just any point to join them it won't really matte.
*SPE1:	is that from the point with the seagull.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	f-- the point fro.
*SPE1:	halfway dow.
*SPE1:	so it's going to go up the wa.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	it's an upwards curv.
*SPE1:	or a downwards curv.
*SPE0:	what do you mea.
*SPE1:	eh is it curving up towards the footbridge or is it down towards the bottom of the pape.
*SPE0:	dow.
*SPE1:	the curve dow.
*SPE0:	dow.
*SPE1:	just a sh-- shallow curv.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	to where i told you the wh-- to mar-- two wh-- inches to th.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	west of "c" to that poin.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	just shallow wee curv.
*SPE0:	uh-huh righ.
*SPE0:	a positive gradien.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	go straight across from there to about two and a half inches from the edge of the pape.
*SPE1:	i'll need to go to about an inc.
*SPE0:	what's ther.
*SPE1:	a banana tre.
*SPE1:	i've got a banana tre.
*SPE0:	another banana tre.
*SPE1:	i've got a banana tree in the bottom left-hand corner of the pape.
*SPE1:	so i'd need to come due wes.
*SPE0:	the extreme botto.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	it's right down in the corne.
*SPE1:	it's abou.
*SPE1:	right in the corner yea.
*SPE1:	it's in the bottom portion reall.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	just now you you'll be about an inch above the botto.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	can you go straight across to about at that level from the bottom to about two inches from the the wes.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	i'd need to go to about an inc.
*SPE1:	have you got anything wes.
*SPE0:	there's nothing on my map ther.
*SPE0:	how fa.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	to go up on the east side of the banana tree.
*SPE1:	yeah that'.
*SPE0:	how far out would you have to b.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE1:	just about half an inch of where i am the now to the wes.
*SPE1:	then i'd need to go up and i've got a footbridge directly above tha.
*SPE0:	how is the banana tree area really big it's a s-.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	it's a huge big banana tree it's about one and a half times the size of crest fall.
*SPE0:	and it stretches from the below the footbridg.
*SPE1:	stretche.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	ju-- aba-- it's about an inch below the footbridge to about an inch fae the edge of the page fae the bottom of the page then about an inch in and it's about an inch and a half acros.
*SPE0:	an inch in from wher.
*SPE1:	an inch in from the left-hand side of the pag.
*SPE0:	and what do you mean an inch and a half acros.
*SPE1:	well that's how wide it is the banana tre.
*SPE0:	that wid.
*SPE1:	ay.
*SPE1:	it's about that wid.
*SPE0:	that wide or that wid.
*SPE1:	that wid.
*SPE1:	where are we going to go anyway are we going try to get up th.
*SPE0:	thing is right you go along the bottom right and my route about just over an inch from the side of the pag.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	goes up again until you're almost on a level with footbridg.
*SPE1:	well is that only an inch from the sid.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	oh i can do tha.
*SPE0:	that's what i told you to go over three inche.
*SPE1:	oh sorr.
*SPE0:	along the botto.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	come along for three inche.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	then go up level with footbridg.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	you'll be abou.
*SPE1:	an inch fae the edge and an inch fae the botto.
*SPE0:	well should make it just more than an inch from the maybe about two inches from the edg.
*SPE1:	wha.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	i can't do that it's the banana tre.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE0:	you'll have to go round them the.
*SPE0:	now go up to wher.
*SPE0:	go slightly curvin.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	ehm until you're at the "f" not to the "f" but on a level with the "f.
*SPE1:	how far west of i.
*SPE0:	and end up on the same sort of the same vertica.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	as the tree trun.
*SPE0:	axis a.
*SPE0:	what tree trun.
*SPE1:	the banana tree trun.
*SPE0:	i don't have the banana tre.
*SPE1:	oh you've no got tha.
*SPE1:	so it's a bi.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	make it that you're about three inches above the point you are just now three inches due nort.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and curve round your banana trees right if you've got t.
*SPE1:	to how far from the edge of the page a couple of inche.
*SPE0:	an inch and a half say from ther.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	got yo.
*SPE0:	now from that point you'll probably be just over two inches from the footbridg.
*SPE1:	ay.
*SPE0:	draw a line from there to the the left-hand side of the footbridg.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	east due eas.
*SPE0:	well almost due east you'll be just below th.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	think i'd on the picture right because you're going to go over the footbridg.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i want to g.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	just go up to the edge of the footbridg.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i'm below the footbridge or right at the edg.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see the bridge bit along the to.
*SPE1:	where i can go over i.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	where you can go over i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	got yo.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	don't draw a line over the footbridg.
*SPE0:	there isn't one her.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	do you have a poisoned stream ther.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	on the other side of the foot-.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	when you come off the footbridge go for about half a centimetre at the very mos.
*SPE1:	so i'm on the right-hand side of the footbridge and i'm going half a centimetr.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	half a centimetre ou.
*SPE1:	eas.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and no.
*SPE1:	where's the poison stream come from slate mountai.
*SPE0:	there isn't a slate mountain on this on.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	but it's below slate mountai.
*SPE0:	now draw a line due sout.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	for about an inch and a half so y-.
*SPE0:	you're still above the start poin.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	right e.
*SPE0:	you have an old templ.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	now see where the "m" o.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	stream i.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	i've no got strea.
*SPE0:	oh sorry righ.
*SPE1:	i'll need be on the mountain somewher.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	on this leve.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	draw a line straight over 'til you're above the "s" of star.
*SPE1:	right due east above lef-- "s" in star.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm about a half an inch above the "s.
*SPE0:	so you'll be abou.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and from there draw in a curve to the the bas.
*SPE0:	see the base bit of the old templ.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	looks as if it's brick or somethin.
*SPE1:	ay.
*SPE0:	draw a curve to ther.
*SPE1:	what the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	just a wee curve going up towards abandoned truc.
*SPE0:	there's no aban-.
*SPE1:	eh well slate mountain you've no got slate mountain white mountai.
*SPE0:	no no not that wa.
*SPE1:	am i going down towards the bottom right-hand corner or up towards the top left-hand corner with the the curv.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you've come across from the footbridg.
*SPE1:	right to the start yea.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	you're just at start no.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	now you know where the old temple i.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	well just draw a wee curve joining those two point.
*SPE1:	what kind of curve thoug.
*SPE1:	'cause i mean i'm walking downward.
*SPE0:	well as i.
*SPE1:	an "n" curve or a "u" curv.
*SPE1:	know what i mea.
*SPE0:	you'll see right say t-- imagine a clock fac.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	between three o'clock and six o'cloc.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	that would be the cur-- that quarter of the clock the way just picture that the way that would g.
*SPE1:	between three o'cloc.
*SPE0:	you're starting off flat and getting steepe.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	from six 'til thre.
*SPE1:	right i've got i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm right at the very side of the ol.
*SPE1:	temple and right on the side of i.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	now go s-- straight up straight north until about an i-- inch above the top of the templ.
*SPE0:	that'll be you near the mountai.
*SPE1:	got yo.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	i'm a quarter of the way up the mountain halfway up the mountain nearl.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	don't draw a line but sa.
*SPE0:	go in a s-- an inch and a hal.
*SPE0:	how far are you fr-- how far are you from the "k" of abandoned truc.
*SPE1:	i'm about right i'm on a level with tha.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	and i'm about three inches to the right of i.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	half take half that distanc.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and go up from there go up just over two inche.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and that'l.
*SPE1:	remote village you got a remote villag.
*SPE0:	not that high u.
*SPE1:	not that hi-.
*SPE1:	well i'm about an inch belo.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE1:	the "v" in tha.
*SPE0:	no maybe take it down another inch the.
*SPE1:	all right so abou.
*SPE1:	so that'll be me about two inches below the "v" in villag.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and about an inch above the top of the truck at the mos.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	uh-huh ther.
*SPE1:	and i want to draw a line fro.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	well where you are ju-- put a put a wee point ther.
*SPE1:	right got on.
*SPE0:	now from where you are just now on the line connect those two point.
*SPE1:	where i am just no.
*SPE0:	to th.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you're just an inch above the old templ.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	go to that point two inches below the "v" of villag.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	straigh.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and no.
*SPE0:	say a s-- three quarters of a centimetre below the "k" of truc.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	now go down to there three quarters of a centimetre uh-hu.
*SPE1:	so it's me going round the old mountai.
*SPE0:	directly below the "k.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	now go how far you'll be about three quarters of a centimetre below the word abandoned truck the word.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	go straight across 'til you're under the "a" by the same distanc.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	now do you have baboon.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	from there go down two inches until you're about an inch from the line you drew to the footpat.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	go straight dow.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and now go across until you're about three quarters of an inch from the side of the page if you can do tha.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	in fact to be safe make it half an inch to get round these baboon.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	have you got anything between this point and white mountai.
*SPE1:	nop.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	from her.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE0:	go up to go straight up to avoid the baboon.
*SPE1:	straight u.
*SPE1:	how fa.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE0:	to about the where you started off to make that a "u" shape that bit of pat.
*SPE0:	you know how you've come down and alon.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	well i've come down i've went above slate mountain down by the abandoned truc.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	from the "a" of abandoned truc.
*SPE1:	ay.
*SPE0:	you've went dow.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and then alon.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	now go back up to about that level to make it a "u" shap.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so if there's just a wee totty bit of monkeys or baboons or whatever you call the.
*SPE0:	in that space ther.
*SPE1:	so you want like nine o'clock 'til twelve o'cloc.
*SPE0:	it's maybe about a couple of inches wid.
*SPE0:	make sure you're eh.
*SPE1:	i go north and then across a bit e.
*SPE0:	make sure you're still at least two inches from the gap that down that "u" shape will be at least two inches at all point.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	so just go up to make that a "u.
*SPE0:	and you're about half an inch from the side of the pape.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	so i want to go where am i ending up beside the "a" agai.
*SPE0:	well just go straight up until you're on the level of where you star-- at "a" below "a" three quarters of a centimetre below "a.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	from there draw a line straight to the bottom left-hand starting point of white mountain maybe just to about half a centimetre to the w-- the left of i.
*SPE1:	right that's m.
*SPE1:	level with the "a" and then up to the bottom left-hand bit of white mountai.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	how am i far from i.
*SPE0:	wher.
*SPE0:	where th-- abou.
*SPE1:	centimetre from the botto.
*SPE0:	at th-- not even tha.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	about half tha.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and no.
*SPE0:	they'll if you g-- as you go up that side of white mountain there's a wee sort of ledge bi.
*SPE0:	you see that where it goes fla.
*SPE1:	m.
*SPE1:	i'm in th.
*SPE0:	you go up quite stee.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	on the mountain and then it flattens out a wee bi.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	right at the top abou.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	below there about a third of the way u.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	there's a wee bit that's almost at a horizonta.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	no it'll be a different drawing mayb.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you see about two thirds of the way up the mountai.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	its gradient changes to slightly less stee.
*SPE1:	mm a wee bi.
*SPE1:	mm a totty totty wee bit ay.
*SPE0:	uh-huh slightl.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	go up follow the side of the mountain up to that point still staying about half a centimetre away to a centimetr.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then have you got anything above that point above white mountai.
*SPE1:	i've got lemon grove that's about two inches above i.
*SPE0:	do you have a pyrami.
*SPE1:	ay.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	g.
*SPE0:	where is the top of the lemon grove uh in relation to the pyrami.
*SPE1:	just on the bottom of i.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	go straight up just now until you're about on go due north until you're on a level with about the a third of the way up the pyrami.
*SPE0:	you see the black marks up the side of the pyrami.
*SPE1:	uh-huh the second on.
*SPE0:	until you're level with the second on.
*SPE1:	so i'm going to go by the west side of the lemon grov.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and now would that take you above the lemon grov.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	now go straight across until you're about an inch from the second black mark of the pyrami.
*SPE1:	black mar.
*SPE1:	got yo.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	from there go to a point a centimetre above the peak of the pyrami.
*SPE1:	got yo.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then draw a straight line down the other sid.
*SPE0:	um you see the the bottom right-h-- right-hand corner of the pyrami.
*SPE1:	yeah the far away one the one that'.
*SPE0:	the one that would be at the front of the pyrami.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	right the face not the one that would be at the back not the extreme right-hand poin.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	about an inch out from there put a dot and join those two points and th.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	immediately below that i've got a poisoned scream stream about two centimetres below i.
*SPE0:	two centimetre.
*SPE0:	the poisoned stream in this one is a bit further below that see i've got two poisoned streams on this ma.
*SPE1:	m.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	from there draw a slightly sloping curve again to below the "d" of pyrami.
*SPE0:	right just slope it round the natural way it would g.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	curve it roun.
*SPE1:	curve it round with the like that or like tha.
*SPE0:	to below the d-.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	where you are just now remember you do drew the test tube earlie.
*SPE1:	is it an arc curv.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	it would be like the bottom half of that test tub.
*SPE1:	so it's like tha.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	to below the "d.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	do you have a cobbled stree.
*SPE1:	got that's about a s-.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	it's about a centimetre below th-- the "d.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	from there go carry on straight across until you're below the far left-hand base point of the pyrami.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	so about an inch yea.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	now at about a hundred and ninety-five degrees so that's just five degrees more than sout.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	to the west side go down about well make it a hundred an.
*SPE0:	what did i say ther.
*SPE1:	hundred and ninety-five you sai.
*SPE0:	right that's fin.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	from there go dow.
*SPE0:	do you have a remote villag.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	you see the the two dark thick lines that are in that drawing of remote villag.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	go down until straight down at that angle until you're about a centimetre to the side t-- to the west of the lin.
*SPE1:	so you've got the remote village it's got two hills it's got the remote village is in the middle of two hills with hills behin.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	and you want the the hill on the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	until you're about a centimetre to the w-- west of tha.
*SPE1:	you're about a centimetr.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	so just dra.
*SPE1:	dead on the level of it uh-hu.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	got yo.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	from there draw another curve until you're below the "r" of r-- about a centimetre below the "r" of remot.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then go straight across to below the "e" of villag.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and then go about an inch further than that on the same level and that's your finishing poin.
*SPE1:	so that'll be just about below the pyramid the extreme right-hand edg.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	just ther.
*SPE1:	righ.
