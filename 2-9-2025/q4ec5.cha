*SPE0:	okay ehm righ.
*SPE0:	take your line from the start and go vertically down past burnt fores.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	you hav.
*SPE1:	yeah i i've got a burnt fores.
*SPE1:	but i've got a carpenter's cottage underneath tha.
*SPE0:	okay it's underneat.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	i want you to c-- i want you to take your line vertically down past burnt forest and past the carpenter's cottage righ.
*SPE0:	and just listen for a minut.
*SPE0:	and then the carpenter's cottage is to the left of a ravin.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	i want you to take the line underneath the carpenter's cottage and then go vertically upwards through carpenter's cottage and the ravin.
*SPE1:	between the tw.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	okay do tha.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	okay now you're at the top of the ravine eh.
*SPE0:	is there a remote village above the ravin.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	i don't have a remote villag.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	well if you could just imagine that's above the ravine on a horizontal line with burnt fores.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	and go horizontally towards your right above the ravin.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	and where do i sto.
*SPE0:	stop ah midway between the ravine and the pine grov.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	now i want you to take that line go down towards pine grove just stop beside the writing pine grov.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	right with a vertical line straight dow.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oh right and do you have any obstructions underneath the pine grov.
*SPE1:	well there's an avalanche just to the right of it ehm and there's er a concealed hideou.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	i want you to get to the concealed hideou.
*SPE1:	just below ther.
*SPE0:	so eh.
*SPE0:	is the avalanche to the right or the left of the pine grov.
*SPE1:	it's to the righ.
*SPE0:	to the right oka.
*SPE1:	and just slightly below as wel.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	well keep to the left-hand side of the avalanche draw the line downwards towards th-- slightly towards the right okay i want you to go really close to the avalanche but don't go past it and then keep that line going vertically downwards until you get just above the top of the concealed hideou.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	eh are you trying to az-- avoid an obstacle her.
*SPE0:	i'm trying to avoid your avalanche but there's nothing her.
*SPE1:	so does it oh how does it how does the line go does it go just like a straight line between just below pine grove to the hi-- concealed hideout o.
*SPE0:	if you can draw that straight line withou.
*SPE1:	i can ye.
*SPE0:	withou.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	okay right that's fin.
*SPE0:	without getting in the avalanche that's fin.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	s-- and eh i want to be just abov.
*SPE0:	just above the the peak of the concealed hideou.
*SPE1:	right righ.
*SPE0:	okay that's fine righ.
*SPE0:	now i want you to go round ehm to your left of the concealed hideou.
*SPE0:	is there a boat hous.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	oh there's a boat house on the e.
*SPE0:	uh-huh bu.
*SPE1:	to the right and dow.
*SPE0:	i wa-- ehm i've got one to the lef.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	uh-huh righ.
*SPE0:	ehm so if you can imagine there's a boat house there so it's kind of like in the middle of the whole ma.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	is it in the wee bulge eh just above crane ba.
*SPE0:	it's above that directly above tha.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	okay if you can imagine that's there i want you to go i want you to draw it round concealed hideout come to the to the right of concealed hideou.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	eh to the right of concealed hi-- hideou.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	so take that line that have you drawn an.
*SPE1:	is this is just to the left is this a right on the map or a le-- a right o-.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	the right of concealed hideou.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	and tha.
*SPE0:	and then continue the line underneath concealed hideout so you're drawing to the right and then underneath concealed hideou.
*SPE1:	and underneath to the left do you mean like going from left to right underneath the concealed l-- hi-- hideou.
*SPE0:	from right to left uh-hu.
*SPE1:	from right to left right oka.
*SPE1:	so i come round the the concealed hideou.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	from right to lef.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	and then sto.
*SPE1:	and then i go do i go down to that bulge yea.
*SPE0:	do you see the bulg.
*SPE0:	it's like a it's an incline that goes down right the c-- the the coastline of crane bay comes up and it peaks at the top to the right of concealed to the left sorry of concealed hideou.
*SPE0:	okay you see tha.
*SPE0:	and then it falls again there's a d-- a big dent in crane bay just above where it it actually says crane ba.
*SPE1:	yes i see that righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	well i want you to draw the line from where you are just now and then if you could make it meet the coastline where that dent i.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	and i want you to follow it until it peaks agai.
*SPE1:	right i see you righ.
*SPE1:	so you're drawing a to a straight line between those two eh peak.
*SPE0:	well i want i-- you to actually follow i.
*SPE1:	oh righ.
*SPE1:	to the right to curve round righ.
*SPE0:	to ba.
*SPE0:	yeah uh-hu.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	so eh i'm going for a straight line from concealed hideout to the first eh cres.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	and then do a curved lin.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	until you come to the next peak ther.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	okay righ.
*SPE0:	from now on you're going to go generally in a diagonal from right to lef.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	but i want you to draw abov.
*SPE0:	have you got pebbled shor.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	well on my map above directly above pebbled shore there's coconut pal.
*SPE1:	there's no such thing on this ma.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	so i want you to draw from right to left in a in a diagonal passing the top of pebbled shore okay can you do that and just stop at the end of pebbled shore ther.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	so it's just a diagonal from that first crest to above pebbled shor.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	can you make it can you make that a diagonal sink downwards a bi.
*SPE1:	what you you mean curv.
*SPE0:	can make it curve dow-- curve downwards a bi.
*SPE1:	right so to make it curve above pebbled shor.
*SPE0:	but s-.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	but still so that it's more following the the li-- the coastline again okay but coming away to g.
*SPE1:	where where is the object eh you're trying to avoi.
*SPE0:	it's a-- above pebbled shor.
*SPE1:	it'.
*SPE0:	to the right of pebbled shore just abov.
*SPE1:	above and to the right right i understand now i-.
*SPE1:	is it ehm how far roughly is it from the the coastlin.
*SPE0:	ehm the same distance away as pebbled shore is away from the lower coastlin.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	right so curve righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	what have you got below pebbled shor.
*SPE1:	there's eh washed stone.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	i don't have tha.
*SPE0:	i want ehm you see where the flagship i.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	uh-huh oka.
*SPE0:	in a horizontal line from the flagships okay imagine a line drawn there that's the finishing line about a centimetre away from the coastlin.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	to the lef.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and i want you to draw from where you are just now in a semicircular shape until you come horizontal with a lin.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	beside the flagship can you do that avoiding whatever you've got underneath the pebbled shor.
*SPE1:	ehm does this does this curve follow th-.
*SPE0:	that's towards the righ.
*SPE0:	towards the left sorr.
*SPE1:	does the curve follow the coastline or does it f-- go the opposite wa.
*SPE0:	f-- it goes towards the edge of the pape.
*SPE1:	right ah righ.
*SPE1:	and the the f-- the finish is just to the is betwee.
*SPE0:	it is to the left of the flagshi.
*SPE1:	the eh the flagship and the edge of the pape.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	about a centimetre away from the coastlin.
*SPE1:	right okay s.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
