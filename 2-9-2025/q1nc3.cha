*SPE0:	the diamond mine is that on the right-hand side of your pag.
*SPE1:	it's the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	a.
*SPE0:	the fast flowing river is at the to.
*SPE1:	righ.

*SPE0:	s.
*SPE1:	right so w-- anyway so at the diamond mine righ.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	and i have to curve underneat.
*SPE1:	start go down come underneath the diamond min.
*SPE0:	curve underneat.
*SPE0:	have you got s-- see between the fast flowing river and the diamond mine have you got anythin.
*SPE1:	nop.
*SPE0:	right s.
*SPE1:	got canoe.
*SPE0:	i've got a graveyard ther.
*SPE1:	right i se.
*SPE1:	whereabouts is tha.
*SPE0:	eh really just right in the middle of the two the fast flowing mine fast flowing river and the diamond min.
*SPE1:	s-- righ.
*SPE1:	so where've i to go have i to go round that graveyard or somethin.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	you've to miss the graveyard so if yo.
*SPE0:	right you've curved round righ.
*SPE1:	i've g-- right i mean that i i'm still at diamond mine so i'm not sure where to g.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	if you go o-.
*SPE0:	well just start slightly going up the wa.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	to the fast running cree.
*SPE0:	and righ.
*SPE0:	imagine there's a graveyar.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	just in the centre of the diamond min.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and the fast flowing river just imagine tha.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and you j-- you're going round that you're going round the graveyar.
*SPE1:	like as above i.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	below i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so just slightly below it the.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	to wher.
*SPE0:	so you're sort of curving round to the graveyar.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so we're going slightly u.
*SPE0:	you're going round the graveyar.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	but i can't imagine where the graveyard is righ.
*SPE0:	i know you don'.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	it's jus.
*SPE0:	just imagine it's the same size as the diamond mine and the fast flowing river i-- right but it's parked in the middl.
*SPE1:	right right oka.
*SPE1:	so where are we no.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE1:	so i've to go roun.
*SPE0:	if mmhm.
*SPE1:	but where am i going after tha.
*SPE1:	i've got to know where i'm going this is i.
*SPE0:	you've to you're going round the top of the fast flowing river after you've avoided the graveyar.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	and i curve right round the fast flowing river the.
*SPE0:	uh-huh mmhm.
*SPE1:	where t.
*SPE0:	well righ.
*SPE0:	you go roun.
*SPE0:	the.
*SPE1:	have you got canoe.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	have you got apache cam.
*SPE0:	oh uh-huh i've got an apache cam.
*SPE0:	it's mayb.
*SPE1:	see where you see where fast running creek is and the apache cam.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	bang splat in the middle of that right i've got canoe.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	i don'.
*SPE1:	right s.
*SPE1:	have you got oh you've got you know i've got to go round that s.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	so where are w.
*SPE0:	so if you righ.
*SPE0:	in line with the fast flowing river if you come down maybe one and a half inche.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	eh have you got a carved wooden pol.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	but it's away down at the bottom of the pag.
*SPE0:	oh righ.
*SPE0:	and where's your apache cam.
*SPE1:	just before we're halfway down the pag.
*SPE1:	do-- have you got flat rock.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	it's just above that it's about a couple of inches but up above tha.
*SPE0:	yeah that's righ.
*SPE0:	so if you like c-- curve round th.
*SPE1:	apache cam.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	don't curve round it j-.
*SPE0:	just you're going m-- forty-five degree angle eh towards the bottom eh left of the page you're going that way you kno.
*SPE1:	towards the walled cit.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i'm going roun.
*SPE0:	and you're going round the outside of the walled cit.
*SPE1:	on what s-- on what sid.
*SPE0:	you're going round the top of the walled city and round the left of it on the left-hand sid.
*SPE1:	s.
*SPE1:	and that's at an angle of forty-five degree.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	right i see righ.
*SPE1:	so from the walled city to where i am just there it's at a forty-five degree angle to where i just wa-- came fro.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	right see where the fast running creek is righ.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE1:	i've just come down a couple of inche.
*SPE0:	you've come down about one and a half inche.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	right s.
*SPE0:	if you do it then do a forty-five degree line for maybe about three inches 'til you're probably in line with the top of the walled cit.
*SPE1:	er.
*SPE0:	that height what you're you've to come down the middle of the page take the forty-five degree line down to the middle of the pag.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i should be around the middle of the pag.
*SPE0:	no not the mi-- the centre no no.
*SPE1:	see where i am just now righ.
*SPE1:	i've come i've come round the top of the fast running cree.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	so i'm really i'd be about i'd be about an inch from the end of the pag.
*SPE0:	that's righ.
*SPE1:	and i'm going straight down from that so still i'm an inch away from the page the end of the pag.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	so now you've got to take it take your line to the left 'til you come int.
*SPE1:	towards the walled cit.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	right so i'm above the walled city now and i've curved right round i.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	i'm just into the left so i'm down at the left-hand side of the page i'm just at the bottom of the walled cit.
*SPE0:	the walled city is just above the cen-- halfway up the page righ.
*SPE1:	uh-huh uh-huh uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and you've you've just curved round tha.
*SPE1:	towards the lef.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and how far is it away from the left-hand side of the pag.
*SPE1:	about two inche.
*SPE0:	that's fin.
*SPE0:	so if you've i-- yeah you've curved roun.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	are you in line with the bottom of the walled cit.
*SPE1:	bottom of it have i got to be in line with tha.
*SPE1:	have i to cu.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	just take it down there so i can tell you how many more inches to go dow.
*SPE1:	so i'm at bottom where the writing is of the walled city so i'm just just t-- in a straight line down there curve right round it 'til i'm ther.
*SPE0:	uh-huh just there yea.
*SPE0:	so uh-hu.
*SPE1:	and er am i going back to the right no.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	you're going straight dow.
*SPE1:	i'm going straight down righ.
*SPE0:	in a slight curve you're taking it down maybe about to as far as a a third of the way up the pag.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	i'm taking it down ther.
*SPE0:	you're com-.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	in a curv.
*SPE0:	just a very slight curve you know really just about vertically you're going dow.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	so righ.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	s.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE1:	i'm at ghost tow.

*SPE1:	i can see tha.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and the flat rocks i'v.
*SPE1:	ard-.

*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	they're more like to the right-hand sid.
*SPE0:	ah halfway up i mea.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	so see where i tell you've got a carved wooden pole and a walled city righ.
*SPE0:	to the righ.
*SPE1:	see the carved wooden pole at the bottom of the page near where the thre.
*SPE1:	can you see a for.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	at the v-.
*SPE1:	see above it that's the carved wooden pol.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	and the righ.
*SPE0:	you should be about an inch and a half above that though shouldn't be down that far ye.
*SPE1:	that's what i mean uh-hu.
*SPE1:	but but see where the carved wooden pole is and you've got see between the walled city and the carved wooden pol.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	i've got a ghost tow.
*SPE0:	oh have yo.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	i don't have anythin.
*SPE1:	right wel.
*SPE1:	so where am i going from walled cit.
*SPE1:	i'm at the ghost town that's it ri-- right between the carved pole and the walled city i'm right in the middle of tha.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	well you should curve just you you'll have to go below th.
*SPE1:	ghost tow.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	right i s-- ay.
*SPE0:	right just curve round i.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and have you got a stone cree.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	where's tha.
*SPE0:	is that about a third of the way u-- up the pag.

*SPE1:	to like right-hand sid.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	well you're going above tha.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and you're going up to where the flat rocks are you're just curving u.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	you're avoiding the stone creek in but you're below the flat rocks just very close to the flat rock.
*SPE1:	below the flat rock.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	and i go underneath the flat rock.
*SPE0:	so it's just like a c-.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	it's like a curv.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE0:	so if you take your line to the end of the flat rock.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	there's saloon ba.
*SPE0:	then you're goin.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	you got buffal.
