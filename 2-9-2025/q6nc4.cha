*SPE0:	ehm i was going to say where where the says finish but of course that's not particularly usefu.
*SPE0:	ehm a couple of i'd say five centimetres above the saloon bar and just off a few centimetres off the side of the map on the left-hand side that's where the finish i.
*SPE1:	oh right eh.
*SPE1:	i've come down to the left of the saloon bar and i'm like at the bottom of the saloon bar just no.
