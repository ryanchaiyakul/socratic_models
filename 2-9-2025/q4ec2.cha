*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go vertically down until you're underneath eh diamond min.
*SPE0:	then eh go right until you're between springbok --boks and highest viewpoin.
*SPE1:	wher.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	right go righ.
*SPE1:	don't think i've got that on min.
*SPE0:	ah righ.
*SPE1:	right directly to your righ.
*SPE0:	right to your right where what is the next obstacl.
*SPE1:	ehm quite far over is overgrown gull.
*SPE0:	overgrown wha.
*SPE1:	right so where you've got highest viewpoint is there anything below tha.
*SPE0:	ehm n.
*SPE1:	well i've got overgrown gull.
*SPE0:	ah right overgrown gull.
*SPE0:	there's no such thing eh on my ma.
*SPE0:	ehm the next one you've got to go to can you see springboks on your.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	where's that in relation to highest viewpoin.
*SPE0:	it's right next to it virtuall.
*SPE1:	to its right or lef.
*SPE0:	to its lef.
*SPE1:	on the same level as highest viewpoint yea.
*SPE0:	just slightly below i.
*SPE1:	okay righ.
*SPE0:	right n-.
*SPE0:	go along to your right eh from where you last drew eh in a straight line horizontall.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and then go up between the the two words springboks and highest viewpoin.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and then ehm once you then go round the top eh go to your right eh horizontally g.
*SPE0:	wh-- wh-- where are you at the moment are you just at s-- springboks her.
*SPE1:	well where i think that i.
*SPE1:	and the highest viewpoint's above where i am just no.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE0:	right go vertically up then between the the springboks and highest viewpoin.
*SPE1:	okay am i meant to be trying to go under highest viewpoint like unde.
*SPE0:	no n.
*SPE0:	you're meant to be going between eh springboks and highest po-- viewpoin.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	and once you get to above highest viewpoint eh you go horizontall.
*SPE1:	above highest viewpoin.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE0:	above highes.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	right then go eh uh to your right horizontall.
*SPE0:	then eh come once you're once you've eh passed highest viewpoint eh and there's nothing below you a-- eh apart from safari truc.
*SPE0:	if you can see that ther.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	right go vertically down to just above s-- eh safari truc.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	right now what you want to do is diagonally eh from eh right to left go eh in front of safari truc.
*SPE1:	like coming underneath i.
*SPE0:	ehm you go up safari no no i don't mean go underneath i.
*SPE0:	go like over it as it wer.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	eh right so you're actually going from going diagonally eh from right to left above safari tr-- truc.
*SPE1:	oh oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	to wher.
*SPE0:	to just ehm below the level of field statio.
*SPE1:	not got tha.
*SPE1:	have you got banana tre.
*SPE0:	aye the banana tree bu-.
*SPE0:	is there a field station there as wel.
*SPE1:	no nothing ther.
*SPE1:	oh yeah yes uh-hu.
*SPE0:	yeah righ.
*SPE1:	so i'm going towards field statio.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	go towards field station righ.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	until you're eh u-- just underneath the level of the words field statio.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	these are identical maps i hop.
*SPE0:	right eh righ.
*SPE0:	then you want to go horizontally eh from eh right to left eh above the banana tree above eh the actual banana tree itsel.
*SPE1:	i just double back the wa.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE0:	like tha.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	where t.
*SPE0:	right just p-- until you're past banana tre.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	then come vertically down until you come to gold min.
*SPE1:	don't have a gold min.
*SPE0:	you don't have a gold min.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	you must have a gold mine somewhere yea.
*SPE1:	i don't i didn't have tha.
*SPE0:	is it is it below banana tre.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	rock fall i've go.
*SPE0:	rock fal.
*SPE0:	surely between rock fall and banana tree you've got a gold mine n.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	is it is it anywhere at all nea.
*SPE1:	i've got to the right of banana tree and down there's rope bridg.
*SPE0:	eh say that again to th.
*SPE1:	to the right of banana tree there's a rope bridg.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	now that's slightly down isn't i.
*SPE1:	yeah uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and eh rock fall is like eh it forms a triangl.
*SPE1:	yeah that's right ay.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE1:	where's your gold min.
*SPE0:	well my gold mine is uh the eh the mid point of the banana tree and rock fall lin.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	well no i haven't got tha.
*SPE0:	so you don't have that ehm righ.
*SPE0:	well mine that must mean that this that you can bypass this obstacl.
*SPE0:	so ehm from where you are you're you're you're next to banana tree the word aren't you yeah is that where you ar.
*SPE1:	i'm above banana tre.
*SPE0:	you're certainly above it righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	okay right come eh vertically down to just below the word banana tre.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	now ehm since this obstacle is missing eh we can either go down and follow the exact same path as they've gone or we can go across to the rope bridge and down there eh.
*SPE0:	just wondering i suppose i ought to keep it the same as what they've go.
*SPE0:	so ehm come down 'til you're just below the level of the word rope bridge eh just a vertical line straight down just draw it straight dow.
*SPE1:	from banana tree over to rope bridg.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	well no n.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	just a vertical line straight down ehm to just below the level of rope bridg.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	right and then eh and it's about ehm it's near the midpoint of eh banana tree rock fall lin.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	it's just slightly below tha.
*SPE0:	ehm then you want to go eh right ehm from left to right want to draw horizontal line ehm to about the middle of the page if there's if there's no obstacle ther.
*SPE1:	sorry say that agai.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	right i'm i'm beside rope bridge just no.
*SPE0:	you're bes-- beside rope bridg.
*SPE1:	did you mean just go straight keep going down but not go t.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE0:	i meant to go straight down yea.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	i'll just change tha.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	so you've just drawn a a vertical line from banana tree down righ.
*SPE0:	now you want to go eh from left to right ehm about to the middle of the page roughl.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	then you want to draw a a vertical line from there up the way eh to the same level as the rope bridg.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	not the rope bridge word but the actual rope bridge itsel.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	and this would be like sort of in the centre of the pag.
*SPE0:	it's more or less yes in the centre of the pag.
*SPE1:	roughly oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	the.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	right n-- from there you want to eh go from left to right across the rope bridge and it's actually ehm if if you think of a d-- it was it's not on the rope bridge the word but the rope bridge itself you want the the the line to pass through the diagra.
*SPE1:	uh-huh righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	now do you have giraffes in eh below rope bridge roughl.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	ehm now you want to eh draw a vertical line down from the where you've just left the rope bridge but to the the right of the giraffe.
*SPE1:	do you s-- do you have crocodiles underneath the rope bridg.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	right so there's crocodiles on your.
*SPE0:	ehm there's no crocodiles on min.
*SPE0:	whereabouts are they eh n-- as with respect to the rope bridg.
*SPE1:	directly underneath the right-hand side of the rope bridg.
*SPE0:	right i see righ.
*SPE1:	so if there's no obstruction beneath the rope bridge on the other side before you cross it do you think i could go from directly from there to the giraffe.
*SPE0:	yeah i s-- i suppose i.
*SPE0:	as long as we don't draw over the he-- the crocodiles themselves it'll be oka.
*SPE1:	no that that won't that won't affect i.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE0:	so as long as you avoid them eh if you can just extend your horizontal line out to the the just from the the side of the pag.
*SPE1:	from before crossing the rope bridg.
*SPE0:	well no i'm i want you to cross the rope bridge righ.
*SPE1:	but then i can't actually get from the other end of the rope bridge to the giraffe.
*SPE0:	oh righ.
*SPE0:	so they're so they're actually barring that wa.
*SPE1:	without the crocodile.
*SPE1:	well i imagine s.
*SPE1:	less i just drew round them which i suppose i coul.
*SPE0:	eh can you dr-- actually draw round the.
*SPE1:	well yeah i suppos.
*SPE0:	well if you could draw round them the.
*SPE1:	straight down to the giraffe.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	just to the left eh t-- sorry to the right of the giraffes in between the the edge of the page and the giraffe.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	you want to go from there eh to your eh left just underneath the giraffe.
*SPE0:	now is there any obstacle ther.
*SPE1:	there's the disused warehous.
*SPE1:	you got tha.
*SPE0:	disthouse u-- no i don't have tha.
*SPE0:	it's another obstacle righ.
*SPE0:	ehm if you can just go round eh above the eh disused warehous.
*SPE0:	and then you want to go eh under the great lake and to the finis.
*SPE1:	under the great lak.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	where's the finish just ther.
*SPE0:	well the finish is just between rock fall and great lake it's n-- it's not directly between them but it's on the same level as tha.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	so that's it finished the.
