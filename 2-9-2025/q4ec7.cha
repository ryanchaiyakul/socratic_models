*SPE0:	start top of the extinct volcan.
*SPE0:	it's the bottom right-hand corner of the ma.
*SPE1:	o.
*SPE0:	but it's marked wel.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	i was looking at the to.
*SPE0:	have you found i.
*SPE1:	yeah it's oka.
*SPE0:	right and if you move maybe one and a half centimetres from the top of there to the lef.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and sto.
*SPE1:	is that horizontall.
*SPE0:	horizontally yeah sorr.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	and then go down vertically about maybe five centimetres so you're actually below the extinct volcano you go down the left-hand side of i.
*SPE1:	pen's not working there that's done it oka.
*SPE0:	and stop about you're ther.
*SPE0:	then you go horizontally lef.
*SPE0:	have you got a tribal settlemen.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	that's in the bottom left-hand corner of the ma.
*SPE1:	m.
*SPE0:	it's just a bit below the extinct volcano but sort just about the same level but the opposite sid.
*SPE0:	so you go from that point where you stoppe.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	along to the left-hand corner of the map to about one and a half centimetres from the edg.
*SPE1:	just in a horizontal lin.
*SPE0:	horizontal line straight acros.
*SPE1:	okay do i have to do anything to avoid the the settlemen.
*SPE0:	well if you if you go if you're just below the extinct volcano just now a bit below i.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	you can go straight along and you'll be underneath the tribal settlemen.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	how far away from the edge of the pape.
*SPE0:	one and a half centimetre.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	sto.
*SPE1:	just get my ruler ou.
*SPE0:	have you got a rope bridg.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	if you go straight up the left-hand side of where the tribal settlement would be 'til you're ehm just maybe below the rope bridge but like in a straight line so you're not absolutely underneath it but you're to the left-hand side of it because it curves round over onto the rope bridg.
*SPE0:	you know what i mea.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	so i i go upwards like the same distance away from the pape.
*SPE0:	upwards for abou.
*SPE1:	the edge of the paper until i'm just across from the rope bridg.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	un-.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	'til you've f-- maybe one centimetre below it and then you sort of curve roun.
*SPE1:	below the writing of rope bridg.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	belo.
*SPE0:	belo.
*SPE0:	do you ha-- the left-hand side of the rope bridg.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	but you don't go a straight line and then turn you curve round onto the rope bridg.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	so i'm going to cross the rope bridge yea.
*SPE0:	yes you cro-.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	are you crossing the rope bridg.
*SPE1:	you want me to cross it uh-hu.
*SPE0:	well if you curve round slightly and cross the rope bridg.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	and then stop when you get to the other sid.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	because you've got to curve down ehm it's not a wide cur-- curve it's quite a narrow curve down two centimetre.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE1:	do you have a machet.
*SPE0:	instea.
*SPE0:	no i don'.
*SPE0:	where's the machet.
*SPE1:	it's to the right and just dow.
*SPE0:	from the rope bridg.
*SPE1:	it's to it's about three centimetres to the right and just down from the rope bridg.
*SPE1:	so if i if i curve down and and go underneath where that is is that oka.
*SPE0:	is that curving down a lo.
*SPE0:	'cause it's only about one and a half centimetres two centimetres you've got to curve dow.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	well where would i go once i curve down on your ma.
*SPE0:	you turn right and go straight across so you're th-- you're about three centimetres above the start positio.
*SPE1:	okay that's fin.
*SPE1:	i'll just go underneath it the.
*SPE0:	and stop when you're you'r.
*SPE0:	have you got a collapsed shelte.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	just above ther.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	so i should be like just underneath the collapsed shelter uh-hu.
*SPE0:	about two centimetr-- me-- --metres underneath i.
*SPE1:	that's fin.
*SPE0:	have you got a saxon bar.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	well you go straight up from that point where you wer.
*SPE1:	m.
*SPE0:	past the left-hand side of the collapsed shelte.
*SPE0:	just go straight up until you're on level with the top of the saxon bar.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	so just so just in a diagonal upwards from right to lef.
*SPE0:	and stop ther.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	straight line up to s-- the left-hand side of collapsed shelter so you're on the level with the top of saxon barn but not actually near it you're still on the right-hand side of the ma.
*SPE1:	so it's a it is a diagonal upwards towards th.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	straight line upward.
*SPE1:	well i can't do tha.
*SPE0:	why no.
*SPE1:	'cause my saxon barn's on th.
*SPE0:	no you go straight up the left-hand side of the collapsed shelte.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	you're not going over towards the saxon barn yet you're going to be on the same level with i.
*SPE1:	oh oka.
*SPE1:	have you got a crevass.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	well have you got anything to the right of the saxon bar.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	so if you go straight up would you c-- curve round the crevasse to get to the saxon bar.
*SPE1:	if i went a bit to the right i could just go straight u.
*SPE1:	would that be oka.
*SPE0:	if you go well i was goin.
*SPE1:	so i'd be on like a horizontal line with the saxon barn yea.
*SPE0:	but the the top of i.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	just a bit abov.
*SPE0:	and you go straight up and curve round and then down and underneath the saxon bar.
*SPE1:	say that agai.
*SPE1:	i'm on just now i'm on a horizontal line just beside above the saxon bar.
*SPE0:	but not right over i.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	i'm not beside it ye.
*SPE0:	no righ.
*SPE0:	ehm so you woul.
*SPE0:	ehm is where's the crevasse from there is it underneath yo.
*SPE1:	it's just beside me just now it's just to my right like if i if i went sorry if i went to my left i would pass the crevasse and i would pass the saxon bar.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	so if you go over the top of the crevasse and down the side of it then underneath the saxon bar.
*SPE0:	could you do tha.
*SPE1:	you want me to draw underneath the saxon bar.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE1:	uh-huh oka.
*SPE1:	where will i sto.
*SPE0:	and stop ehm beside the "s.
*SPE1:	of saxo.
*SPE0:	saxo.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	and have you got pelican.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	ehm go down about three to four centimetres from the saxon barn vertically downward.
*SPE1:	so i'm above the rope bridg.
*SPE0:	just a bit above the rope bridge yea.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	the end of i.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and then go underneath where i've got pelicans towards the left-hand sid.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	is that just beside the edge of the paper uh-hu.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	about a centimetre away from i.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	sto.
*SPE0:	have you got a white mountai.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	go straight up from there ehm slightly curving a bit round the white mountai.
*SPE1:	over the top of it uh-hu.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	don't go over it g-- stop when you're parallel to the top of the white mountai.
*SPE1:	okay mmhm.
*SPE0:	and have you got a golden beach at the top left-hand corne.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	go up to go straight up from the top of the white mountain to the edge of the golden beac.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	have you got secret valley or submerged rock.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE0:	so i've got secret valle.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	so you want me to go above secret valle.
*SPE0:	nowhere ne-.
*SPE0:	nowhere near secret valle.
*SPE1:	wha.
*SPE0:	have you have you your golden beach is it at the top left-hand corner or the right-hand corne.
*SPE1:	top right-hand corne.
*SPE0:	oh wel.
*SPE0:	there's one at the top left-hand corner of this map as wel.
*SPE1:	oh oka.
*SPE0:	so you're at the top of the white mountain just no.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	go straight up five or six centimetres and sto.
*SPE1:	right i'm meant to be right on top of white mountain just well just beside the top yea.
*SPE0:	well yes parallel to it uh-hu.
*SPE1:	so oka.
*SPE0:	straight u.
*SPE0:	sto.
*SPE0:	have you got slate mountai.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	go directly along from that point to the end of slate mountai.
*SPE1:	to the right-hand end of the slate mountai.
*SPE0:	uh-huh left-hand end of slate slate mountain 'cause you go over the top of i.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	so just do that then go rou-.
*SPE1:	whe-- where's the golden beach i've got to avoid is that like abov.
*SPE0:	that's in the top left-hand corner yea.
*SPE1:	okay oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	kind of are you over the mountai.
*SPE1:	you want me to go over i.
*SPE0:	just go over it and stop at the other side and curve right round underneath it so that you're about a centimetre underneath the "s.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and you got a secret valle.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	can you go d-- v-- down from there down the left-hand side of the secret valle.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and are you underneath the secret valle.
*SPE1:	hold on you want me to be underneath the secret valle.
*SPE0:	go draw a straight line to the end of just about a centimetre away from the "y" and that's the finis.
*SPE1:	underneath i.
*SPE0:	underneath the "y" of secret valle.
*SPE1:	a centimetre down from the "y" yea.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	that's i.
