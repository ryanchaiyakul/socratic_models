*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	erm should be above the bottom of the page by about two centimetres two and a half centimetre.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	oh should i indee.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	an.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	where are you now you still unde.

*SPE0:	right-hand sid.
*SPE1:	abou.
*SPE1:	left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	go left-hand side of the rope bridge go alon.
*SPE1:	no right-hand side of the rope bridge sorr.
*SPE0:	right-hand sid.
*SPE1:	i thought you meant the pag.
*SPE0:	erm go along by about nine centimetre.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	i.
*SPE0:	up seven centimetre.
*SPE1:	right s.
*SPE1:	where am i in relation to the rope bridge no.
*SPE0:	erm you should be across by about four centimetres eh and under by about four centimetre.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	an.
*SPE0:	curve roun.
*SPE1:	which wa.
*SPE0:	er so the slope it gets lowe.
*SPE1:	oh whe-- whe-- whe-- towards the right or the lef.
*SPE0:	to the righ.
*SPE1:	have you got a saxon bar.
*SPE0:	hu-- you're not up there are yo.
*SPE1:	no i no i'm no.
*SPE1:	should am i going toward the rope bridg.
*SPE0:	yeah towards the rope bridg.
*SPE1:	am i going across the rope bridg.
*SPE0:	across the rope bridg.
*SPE1:	am i going across the r-- right it's across the rope bridg.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	stop after you you reach the end of the rope bridg.
*SPE1:	right i'm at the other end of the rope bridge righ.
*SPE0:	and down by three centimetre.
*SPE1:	have you got machet.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	where whereabouts is the machet.
*SPE1:	it's along by about three centimetres and couple down from the rope bridg.
*SPE0:	a couple dow-- oh righ.
*SPE1:	right okay righ.
*SPE0:	are you close to i.
*SPE1:	not ye.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	not ye.
*SPE1:	so three centimetres down from the rope bridg.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	how close are you to it no.
*SPE1:	abou.
*SPE0:	are you er directly across from i.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	er under i.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	not directly under it but under i.
*SPE0:	under it by enough to miss i.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	yeah am i going right no.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	er you go right by eight centimetre.
*SPE1:	above the start poin.
*SPE0:	yes above the start poin.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i should be above the start point no.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	you should be above the start poin.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and do you see a collapsed shelte.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	above you to the righ.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	you go to the left of thi.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and by about twelve centimetre.
*SPE0:	up is is there an an obstacle er.
*SPE1:	have you got a crevass.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	acro-- along from the saxon barn at al.
*SPE1:	i've got a crevass.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	is that directly along from the saxon bar.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	well go above tha.
*SPE1:	above the c-.
*SPE0:	up and you go directly beside the collapsed shelter by about er say fifteen centimetres above the creva-- crevic.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so have you go.
*SPE1:	right s.
*SPE1:	go about five centimetres above the crevass.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	directly above the start poin.
*SPE0:	five centimetres above the crevi-- crevass.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	which is fifteen centimetres from where i am no.
*SPE0:	eh wel.
*SPE0:	not as much as tha.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE1:	okay righ.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE1:	that's where i want to b.
*SPE0:	by about a centimetre above the crevasse the.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	and go along the top of the crevass.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	to cross to the left-hand side of i.
*SPE0:	e.
*SPE0:	b.
*SPE0:	you've got the saxon barn haven't yo.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	you go along and you go from above the crevasse well from the side down to under just under the saxon barn in a slop.
*SPE1:	so i'm curving ab-- i'm sloping the.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	so i'm now under the saxon bar.
*SPE0:	er at the right-hand sid.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	yes wel.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	and go along 'til you get to the end of the saxon bar.
*SPE1:	righ.

*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	and is there a an do you see another obstacl.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	below n.
*SPE0:	g.

*SPE0:	a white mountain whereabouts o.
*SPE1:	directly above the saxon bar.
*SPE0:	no no no n.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	no it's belo.
*SPE0:	erm go down by about four centimetre.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	er.
*SPE0:	go along fou.
*SPE0:	well go along fiv.
*SPE1:	which wa.
*SPE1:	which wa.

*SPE0:	er.
*SPE0:	just under halfway yea.
*SPE1:	just tons to g.
*SPE0:	and you've got the white mountain above you yea.
*SPE1:	yeah righ.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	you go up say six centimetres u-- dilec rectly across from the saxon barn to your lef.
*SPE1:	so i'm now opposite the saxon bar.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and you slope towards the white mountain and past the white mountai.
*SPE1:	on the right-hand sid.
*SPE0:	the slop.
*SPE0:	on the left-hand sid.
*SPE1:	the lef.
*SPE0:	by one centimetr.
*SPE1:	but that's not sloping it should b.
*SPE0:	well gentle sl-- very gentle slop.
*SPE1:	so i'm now at the left-hand side of the bottom of the white mountai.
*SPE0:	er go along the side er away from the m-- white mountain by a-- from the s-- left side of a white mountain by about one centimetr.
*SPE1:	am i to go up to the top of the mountai.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	'til you reach the pea.
*SPE1:	so am i actually going to the peak of the wh-- white mountai.
*SPE0:	sto.
*SPE0:	no you don'.
*SPE0:	you go one centimetre to the left of the peak same level as the peak an.
*SPE1:	t.
*SPE1:	wait a minute one centimetre to the left of the pea.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	need my tippex no.
*SPE0:	so it's lik.
*SPE1:	right i've got it i've got it righ.

*SPE0:	sss.
*SPE0:	to the righ.
*SPE0:	how close to the righ.
*SPE1:	ah about ten to fifteen centimetres away ten quite a way away anywa.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	not near enough just no.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	go up six centimetres directly u.
*SPE1:	oka.

*SPE1:	the bottom of it yea.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	go along and go along to your right one until you get about one centimetre from the slate mountain again an.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	along the slope one centimetre away from i.
*SPE1:	do i climb it just like the white mountai.
*SPE0:	yeah similar to i.
*SPE0:	yeah you go right over the peak an.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i'm at the to.

*SPE0:	go two centimetres down from the bottom of the sli-- slate mountain on your right just two centimetres dow.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	and go along left 'til you're about one centimetre away from the bottom of the slate mountain directly beneath the slate mountain that i.
*SPE1:	oh on the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	yeah on the left-hand side o.
*SPE0:	one centimetre awa.
*SPE1:	so i'm getting near to where i jumped over the mountai.
*SPE0:	yea.

*SPE0:	go along another couple of centimetres the.
*SPE1:	so i'm under the point where i jumped over the mountain no.
*SPE0:	you're under just well under to you should be under to the lef.
*SPE1:	under the point where i jumped over the mountai.
*SPE1:	off the point where i jumped over the mountai.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	one centimetre to the lef.
*SPE1:	of the poin.
*SPE0:	yea.

*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	a.
*SPE0:	just go about one centimetre down from the where the white mountain is er you should be opposite from the white mountain so one centimetre down agai.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and along you sh-- 'til you're just under the secret right-hand side of the secret valley no.
*SPE0:	and along by one centimetr.
*SPE1:	righ.
