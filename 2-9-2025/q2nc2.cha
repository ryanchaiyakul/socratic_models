*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	then go straight straight o.

*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	now if you take your route from where you are now to that poin.

*SPE0:	and your route'.
*SPE1:	h-- have you got overnight accommodation on your.
*SPE0:	no i don'.
*SPE1:	well i've got overnight accommodation in a diagonal line between the ruined monastery and the point i'm at just no.
*SPE0:	in a diagonal lin.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	it's about if upwards was north it would be northwest of where i am just no.
*SPE0:	yeah oh that sounds that sounds like the same route that i have her.
*SPE0:	does that take you up to the top right-hand corner say of the the ruined monastery you know just off the ruined monaster.
*SPE1:	erm wel.
*SPE0:	by that pa-.
*SPE1:	if i was goi-- to go up in a straight line just now i'd end up slightly to the right of the ruined monaster.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	well it's slightly diagonally northwest as you sai.
*SPE1:	yeah well that's through the overnight accommodation the.
*SPE0:	well that's that'd be goo.
*SPE1:	i don't suppose that's an obstacle reall.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	that'd be quite good actuall.
*SPE1:	right go straight through it the.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	we're going right up there and around the top of the ruined monastery curving round the to.
*SPE1:	curving round the top the right-hand side or the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	oh we're coming up you're coming up on the right-hand sid.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and you're going over to the left-hand side and dow.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	so it's curved down towards the west lak.
*SPE1:	sorry where am i going from the point just now just up northwes.
*SPE0:	up northwes.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	say to the top right-hand corner of the ruined monaster.

*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	past the bottom of the ruined monaster.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	okay now you're going to curve it bac.
*SPE0:	do you have a stil.
*SPE0:	up t.
*SPE1:	eh yeah uh-hu.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	well if you can curve it round until a point that's directly below the left-hand corner of the stil.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and then move straight upwards towards the left-hand side skim round the left-hand side of the stil.
*SPE1:	am i doing an arc eh that's curving up and over to the lef.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	you've just done one that's curved dow.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	from the ruined monastery and you're curving back up now towards the stil.

*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	right at this point across t-- and down to the right-hand side of your page do you have a dead tre.
*SPE1:	eh n.
*SPE1:	i have a dutch elm but er.
*SPE0:	well that'.
*SPE1:	is that the dead tre.
*SPE0:	possibl.

*SPE0:	yeah i've got tha.
*SPE0:	i've got another one across to the righ.
*SPE1:	no i haven't got that on.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	and do you have the east lake up in the top right-hand corne.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	where you are just now should be horizontally across from say just below the bottom right-hand tip of it that's how high you should be on the ma.
*SPE1:	the great viewpoin.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	no from the ea-- the bottom right-hand corner of the east lak.
*SPE1:	bottom right-hand corner uh-hu.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	now you should be say about a half an inch below that only across the other side of the pag.

*SPE1:	oh righ.
*SPE1:	yeah uh-hu.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	what we're going to do then is draw a diagonal line from where you are no.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	down to a point that goes around the outside of the elm tre.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i've got a popular tourist spot erm between the dutch elm and where i am just no.
*SPE0:	do yo.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	so go straight through tha.

*SPE1:	towards the dutch el.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	and which side of the dutch elm should i end up o.
*SPE0:	y-- you're going to draw a line around the outside of it so you should be underneath the dutch el.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i'm drawing a line around the top of the dutch elm ending up at underneath i.
*SPE0:	yeah that's righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	we're going to curve around the outside of the el.
*SPE1:	mmhm.

*SPE1:	i've done that yea.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	this dutch elm you have if you look across the page to the stile agai.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	is it beneath the stile o.
*SPE1:	slightly beneath it the base of the dutch elm is about maybe half an inch below the bottom of the stil.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and away f-- is it about an inch away from the right-hand side of the pag.
*SPE1:	yeah uh-hu.
*SPE0:	oh must be the same tree i would think anywa.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	sounds simila.
*SPE0:	okay you're going to come around the outside of tha.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	you'll be about an inch away from the right-hand s-- edge of the pag.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and you're going to come back in as if you'd drawn about two thirds of a circle around the tree just abou.
*SPE1:	right got yo.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	you don't have a telescope between you and the the east lake n.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	a great viewpoin.
*SPE0:	do you have any kind of marking at al.
*SPE1:	i'v.
*SPE1:	rocket launch pa.
*SPE0:	a rocket launch pa.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	excellen.
*SPE0:	eh no i don't have a rocket launch pad on min.

*SPE0:	see where the "e" i.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	erm if you draw a line if you are just about directly beneath that "e.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	okay draw a line up to the water's edge maybe just to the right of that "e.
*SPE1:	s-- straight u.
*SPE0:	straight up yea.
*SPE1:	just slightly to the right of the "e.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	until you're just like virtually on the water's edg.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	now mark your route along the water's edge to a point that's just past the sort of bottom left-hand edge of i.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	that's pointin.
*SPE1:	bottom left-hand edg.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	if if your line is pointing you-- you're not we're not going to take it that far but if your line is pointing towards the great viewpoint which is on the top left-hand corne.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and you're still underneath the east lake then that's yo.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	right got yo.
*SPE0:	"x" marks the spot and we're finishe.
*SPE1:	so where am i going now to the great viewpoin.
