*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	and i've got a waterfall to the left of the granite quarr.
*SPE0:	i've got a waterfall as wel.
*SPE1:	so you want to go round i.
*SPE0:	well you curve right round it and then down so it's like a "u"-shape curve you curve round and down over the top of the granite quarr.
*SPE1:	roun.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE1:	to the bottom of the waterfal.
*SPE0:	and a bit belo.

*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	no n.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm going round the top of the granite quarry to about below the level of the waterfal.
*SPE0:	quarr.
*SPE0:	an.
*SPE0:	below yeah about an inch below the the word waterfal.
*SPE0:	and you s-- s-- just before you get to there you sort of square off a bi.
*SPE0:	you go start going wes.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm going wes.
*SPE0:	and then you cu-- you sort of curve round it just slightly and up past north past the waterfal.
*SPE1:	so am i going ou.
*SPE1:	i'm about an inc.
*SPE0:	just past the waterfal.
*SPE1:	i'm about an inc.
*SPE0:	the top of the waterfal.
*SPE1:	and a half to the right of the paper the edge of the pape.
*SPE0:	yeah i'.
*SPE0:	about two inche.
*SPE1:	and i'm about er about a centimetre above the waterfal.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you you go ea-- east just past the waterfall on the east hand sid.

*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i go round i.
*SPE0:	so you go back up over your line you go back round just almost parallel to the one you drew to come down to i.
*SPE1:	i see pas.
*SPE1:	i've got lion countr.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	just abou.
*SPE0:	i've got limestone cliff.

*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	it's below no you've got the bottom right-hand ti.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	and then about halfway along that you've got a wee knobbly bit and just below that about two inches below that i've got lion country so if i come back up along the line i'm going to go right across lion countr.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	i've got lime stone cliffs which is the bottom right-hand corner of east lake it's below that right directly below i.
*SPE1:	m.
*SPE0:	er so you've gone round fallen cair.
*SPE0:	where've you got you've you've got t.
*SPE1:	i'm just er i'm just to the right of fallen cairn directly on the top stone about couple of centimetres to the righ.
*SPE0:	that's righ.

*SPE1:	well if a-- am i trying to get back up to where i started below the cornfield.
*SPE0:	y-- you're trying to get up back up to the finish which is just between the cornfields and east lak.
*SPE0:	there's a finish just ther.
*SPE1:	just between the.
*SPE0:	it's the bottom corner the bottom left-hand corner of east lak.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	it's about an inch to the on parallel wi-- on a a line with that but about an inch to the east wes.
*SPE1:	and so i want to go to about ther.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	and that should be about almost halfway across your pag.
*SPE1:	and you go just about parallel to the line befor.
*SPE0:	to that to that lin.
*SPE0:	and then a cut up north past the the limestone cliffs and then skirt part of east lake to the finis.
*SPE1:	s.
*SPE1:	from fallen cairn you want me to go nort.
*SPE0:	you want to get north someho.
*SPE0:	up to abou.

*SPE0:	i start going parallel along i mean skirting along east lake about the line comes up to about the "a" below the "a" and where the east lake's writte.
*SPE0:	and then go p-- i skirt along the lake to the finis.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	s-- so north up to the bottom right-hand corner of east lake if i can do that yea.
*SPE0:	mm up to about the "k" whenever you can get ther.
