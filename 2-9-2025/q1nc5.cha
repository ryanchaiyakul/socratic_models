*SPE0:	and then you're sort of curving just curving basically it's kind of vertically you're going for a vertical kind of curve if you can say that for about maybe four inches down to you're coming down to about the bottom third of the pag.
*SPE1:	do you have a ghost town belo.
*SPE0:	a ghost tow.
*SPE0:	n.

*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	so you're sort of going in between the tw.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	you're curving round 'til nearly you're nearly up at the flat rock.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	your curve's going a way u.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then you're going vertically down again you should be maybe just less than an inch off the right-hand side of the pag.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	do you have a saloon ba.
*SPE0:	where's tha.
*SPE1:	just underneath the flat rock.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	i've got a stone cree.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	and i i'm kind of above the stone creek at the momen.
*SPE0:	have well have yo.
*SPE1:	haven't gone down yet wait a minut.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	so you've to go past the flat rocks you know below but you've to go over 'til you're really about an inch the from right-hand side of the pag.
*SPE1:	oh right oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	and down agai.
*SPE0:	and then down agai.
