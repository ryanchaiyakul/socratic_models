*SPE0:	right eh from start position you move down past the camera shop to the bottom left corne.
*SPE1:	right righ.
*SPE1:	the camera shop's ri-- directly below the start position righ.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE0:	you move down to l-- past the left-hand side of the camera sho.
*SPE1:	no righ.
*SPE0:	and have you got parked van marked there beneath the camera sho.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	no-- it's just allotments to the eh righ.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	and slightly belo.
*SPE0:	you mov.
*SPE0:	well approximately three inches below the camera shop you make an arc and then move up up and around the left-hand side of the allotment.
*SPE1:	and where do i sto.
*SPE0:	stop just at the bot-- the top right corner of the allotments just above that little she.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	then you move in an angle slo-- sloping slightly upwards to approximately a third of the way across the page from the right and sto.
*SPE1:	so what is this eh there's a flight museum here on th.
*SPE0:	it's not marked on my ma.
*SPE1:	oh righ.
*SPE1:	ehm it's eh on the same level as the start position basicall.
*SPE0:	slightly below approximately on level with the top of the camera sho.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so you make an angle and that's a straight lin.
*SPE0:	a straight line ye.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	from there to just above the camera sho.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	approximately two thirds away t-- from the right-hand side of the pag.
*SPE1:	uh from the right-hand side of the pag.
*SPE0:	no sorr.
*SPE0:	one third away from the right-hand side of the pag.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	that's just below the flight museu.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	well pu-.
*SPE0:	have you got yacht club marked bottom right corne.
*SPE1:	yes uh-hu.
*SPE0:	well it's just slightly to the left of the yacht club on a level with the camera shop roo.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	and where do we go after tha.
*SPE0:	you turn straight up the page and make a straight line which curves over and around top of the disused monaster.
*SPE0:	have you got that mar.
*SPE1:	what on top of the monaster.
*SPE0:	above the monaster.
*SPE1:	and t-- uh right okay that's oka.
*SPE0:	to the left up the to the right and then curves over to the lef.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so we're going from like above the allotments to just above the yacht club no just above but ehm abou.
*SPE0:	approximately three inche.
*SPE1:	same level as the camera shop basicall.
*SPE0:	three four inche.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	and then eh from there going to disused monaster.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	curving around the top of the disused monaster.
*SPE1:	yeah righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so curve around the disused monastery then wher.
*SPE0:	and stop on the level with the base of it then the curve reverses itself and goes approximately li-- like it was before and then goes vertically up the side of the gr-- the alpine garde.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	could you just say that agai.
*SPE0:	right from the disused monastery the left-hand side of disused monastery the curve makes a dip rather than a rise a troug.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and stops level with the left-hand side of the alpine garde.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so it's a a curve eh pointing upwards to get to the disused monaster.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	a curve poin-- going down the way u.
*SPE1:	that's what i mea.
*SPE1:	i mean eh the apex of the curve is higher than the two base points basicall.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	and then a the reverse of the concavity of the thing to come round to the alpine garde.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	you stop on a level with the m-- disused monastery to slightly to the left of the alpine garde.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	then you go up vertically 'til just above the alpine garde.
*SPE0:	then you mak-- go right to the end of the alpine garde.
*SPE0:	then vertically again to the top of the youth hoste.
*SPE1:	there is no youth hoste.
*SPE0:	then about three inche.
*SPE1:	where was the youth hoste.
*SPE0:	youth hostel was t-- upwards and to the right of the alpine garden if you go up from four inches from where you stopped at the alpine garden verticall.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	right i think i know where it i.
*SPE1:	right ehm where where would i be going after tha.
*SPE0:	after wher.
*SPE1:	after the this youth hoste.
*SPE0:	after youth hoste.
*SPE0:	you'd be going an inch to your right and then a diagonal line sloping at approximately eh what'd it be now hundred and thirty five degrees from vertica.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	eh can you give me a name of an object i'll be going t.
*SPE0:	the telephone bo.
*SPE1:	right okay uh righ.
*SPE1:	so i go up just below th-- just to below the parked va.
*SPE1:	have you got a parked va.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	you go to about t-- two inches below the parked va.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	and then from ther.
*SPE0:	you g.
*SPE1:	so it'.
*SPE0:	two inches right from that and then a straight line diagonally 'til underneath the telephone bo.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	all righ.
*SPE1:	underneath the telephone telephone bo.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	not directly underneath i.
*SPE1:	eh.
*SPE0:	you're going to draw a s-- you're going to have to draw a straight line adding on to that that passes underneath the telephone bo.
*SPE1:	right right oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	then there's a straight line going under the telephone bo.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and a vertical line going up the right-hand side of the telephone bo.
*SPE1:	and where does it go t.
*SPE0:	it stops about level with the top of the telephone bo.
*SPE0:	then there's a sort of exponential curve that goes up to your right from that point and it starts to become vertical to the left of the telephone box on a l-- line left of the telephone bo.
*SPE1:	and where's it going to is it going to the level crossin.
*SPE0:	it's goin.
*SPE0:	not marked on my ma.
*SPE0:	it's going to the right to the left of the thatched mud hut an.
*SPE1:	i don't have a thatched mud hu.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	whe-- have you got an east lak.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE0:	it stops approximately th-- on a line through the middle of the east lak.
*SPE1:	mm righ.
*SPE1:	ehm well i've got a level crossing just below the the the ehm east lak.
*SPE0:	it'll probably mean go through that the.
*SPE1:	through the level crossin.
*SPE1:	ehm aren't we meant to eh avoid obstacle.
*SPE0:	avoid the.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	right eh.
*SPE1:	i need to go ehm where where is it going is it going to eh eh parked van or some plac.
*SPE0:	ehm n.
*SPE1:	eh wher.
*SPE0:	it's going to the right of the parked van underneath the lef-- the very left-hand point of the east lak.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so it's between eh.
*SPE0:	it's on a level with the picket fenc.
*SPE0:	have you got that top left corne.
*SPE1:	yeah i've got tha.
*SPE0:	the finish point is on a level with that underneath the most left point of the east lak.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	r-- i'll go round it the level crossin.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	is it a straight line or a curv.
*SPE0:	it curve.
*SPE0:	eh if the telephone box is there it curves up and then goes like tha.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	from that's from seen from my point of vie.
*SPE1:	and that's from the right-hand side of the telephone bo.
*SPE0:	from the right-hand side of the telephone box it goes to the left-hand poin.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	well i can't do an exponential s.
*SPE0:	that's the path marked ther.
*SPE1:	i'll see what i can d.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	that you at the finish poin.
*SPE1:	i'm just at the eh left-hand bottom corner of the east lak.
*SPE0:	the left-hand bot-- corne.
*SPE0:	you go just about an inch to your lef.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and that's the finish poin.
*SPE0:	on a level with the picket fenc.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	on a level with the picket fenc.
