*SPE0:	ehm righ.
*SPE0:	you start at the caravan par.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	ehm if you go down about three inches down uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then across about two and go back up i.
*SPE1:	do i go past the picket fenc.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE0:	we're goin.
*SPE0:	see the old mill can you find the old mill on your ma.
*SPE1:	the mill whee.
*SPE0:	it's an old mil.
*SPE1:	i don't have an old mill it says mill wheel must be the same thin.
*SPE0:	okay righ.
*SPE1:	s.
*SPE1:	i go down from the caravan park bef-- turn right before the picket fenc.
*SPE0:	you go to the old mil.
*SPE0:	there's no picket fence here e.
*SPE1:	you don't have a picket f-.
*SPE1:	i've a i've got a picket fence about three inches down from the caravan par.
*SPE1:	so i need to stop short of that and turn right right and go and pass beneath the mill wheel or the old the old mill as you have i.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	i go down and then i turn right n-- no then i turn left and then i go back up past the old mill so it's like a curve it's like a curve going up down and then up again past the ol.
*SPE0:	have you got is old mill quite near the caravan par.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	it's about i mean maybe an inch and a half or two inches southeast of it on min.
*SPE0:	m.
*SPE0:	and ha-- have you to go have you to go there like in you've not you've not to pass the ca-- you've not to pass that fenc.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE1:	if i went three inches down from the caravan park i would you know i'd more or less hit the picket fenc.
*SPE0:	so the.
*SPE0:	right i se.
*SPE0:	so is that the idea of this then so you you're going straight to where i am instead of going round the picket fenc.
*SPE0:	if i say if i say that you've to go to the old mill firs.
*SPE1:	where's you.
*SPE1:	actually go to i.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	i you know i wouldn't have to really go down i could just i could just go you know down and to the right rather than go down and then turn right sort of thin.
*SPE0:	hm.
*SPE0:	but is the idea is the idea so that you don't go there to the picket fence if i'm going to the old mill firs.
*SPE1:	wh-- where wh-.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE1:	i you i don't suppose you you you can go outside the picket fenc.
*SPE1:	eh i i could i could go down about you know two and a half inches and then go right and that would take me underneath my mill wheel right you know beneath it so that not not beneath it n-- on the map beneath it on the ma.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	you kno.
*SPE1:	so i can go down and then to the right and and you know another couple of inches and that's me below the mill whee.
*SPE0:	the old mil.
*SPE1:	is that oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	can you can you s-- s-- can you s-- well can you see the abandoned cottag.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	that's in the middle of my map right in the middle of the pag.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	so if m.
*SPE0:	so if you go to the old mill and then y-.
*SPE1:	i'd if i need to go beneath the old mill righ.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	further along to the right and then up about six or seven inches 'til you get to the abandoned cottage so i d-- i do that do .
*SPE0:	mmhmm mmhmm mmhm.
*SPE0:	so you're going to your right old now going out to your right and then eh straight up to the round the abandoned cottage righ.
*SPE1:	okay so i right wel.
*SPE1:	i've not drawn anything ye.
*SPE1:	i'll go down from the caravan park righ.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	and then righ.
*SPE0:	is the point so that you it's not so that you d-- you avoid that that fence or have you got to go by that fenc.
*SPE1:	i've avoided the fence no.
*SPE0:	right you have righ.
*SPE1:	i'm i'm going right under the the mill oka.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	and up no.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	you ma-- you're actually meant to over the mil.
*SPE1:	over the mil.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	as in on the left-hand side of it you know what i mean like going up round it on the ma.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE1:	my caravan park is on the left-hand side of the mil.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	so is thi.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i could ju-.
*SPE0:	it's on the it's on the far left isn't i.
*SPE1:	yeah my caravan park's on the far lef.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	but the mill wheel's to the right of i.
*SPE0:	uh-huh that's fin.
*SPE0:	so if you you're going to the old mil.
*SPE1:	first of al.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	it's the very first place i g.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE1:	i can just draw a line straight between the two the.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	yeah but on my map it's not got that it's e.
*SPE0:	you're going in a sort of curve to the bottom of the map then round the old mil.
*SPE1:	round beneath the old mil.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	you don't actually go under the old mill you go like round i.
*SPE0:	lik.
*SPE0:	see the side where the steps ar.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	lik.
*SPE0:	that's how you go just just go round the to.
*SPE1:	you actually go round the side where the where the wheel i.
*SPE0:	no the other sid.
*SPE1:	the other sid.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	where where the steps are and round the r-- on top of the roof and then you go round to your righ.
*SPE0:	just keep going right then straight up round the abandoned cottag.
*SPE1:	i mea.
*SPE1:	surely you could just go you know you could just go straight from the caravan park to the abandoned cottage could you no.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	well o-- on the route on this map is you've to go dow.
*SPE1:	so right s.
*SPE1:	i'd b-- i'd have to draw a curve then from the down from the caravan par.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	from the mill wheel and up to the abandoned cottage to the right like a tick shape it'd be s-- the shape of a tick from the th.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	the shape of a like an oval shape from the caravan park you start just above the caravan.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	ma-- make mark across above the caravans go round like just like an oval like half an until you come to sort of top of the old mill like say th.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	the corner of the roo.
*SPE1:	then up to the abandoned cottag.
*SPE0:	then uh-hu.
*SPE0:	do a curve right up to your righ.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'll draw tha.
*SPE0:	sort of d-- gradual curve to your righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	e.
*SPE1:	where does it sto.
*SPE0:	see where the fenced meadow i.
*SPE1:	the bottom righ.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	do you go over the abandoned cottage or under i.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	see where the fenced meadow is at the bottom of your pag.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	when you go right from the old mill go right and just where eh that you start you come to the beginning of that drawing on the right go straight up round the abandoned cottag.
*SPE1:	you're saying you go from the m-- the old mill to the fenced meado.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	you go you're above the fenced meadow the the route is actually above tha.
*SPE1:	i've g-.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	okay it's basi-- i.
*SPE0:	see if you go over the old mil.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	right you're o-- you're o-- eh over the the roof righ.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and you're going make a gradual slope to your righ.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	quite steep though up the up the wa.
*SPE0:	no quite just sort a wee gradual on.
*SPE1:	towards the fores.
*SPE0:	towards fe-- where the hell's the fores.
*SPE1:	the forest fro.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	there there's no fores.
*SPE1:	the forest is beneath the abandoned cottage right on on my ma.
*SPE1:	to get to the fenced meadow i'd need to go down from the mil.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	you don't want to go to the fenced meadow anywa.
*SPE0:	i'm just telling i'm giving you a g-- i because it's lik.
*SPE1:	why did you mention i.
*SPE0:	you stop you stop going right above the fenced meadow where you come to that drawin.
*SPE1:	in other words the the bottom right-hand side of the abandoned cottag.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	surel.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you're at the old mill go back to the old mil.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	yeah i'm ther.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see the roo.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	go over the roo.
*SPE1:	yeah mmhm.
*SPE0:	keep going righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	'til about th-.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE0:	let's start again in different term.
*SPE0:	see about three quarters of the way to your right in the pag.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	stop right when you've go-- drawn your line from the old mill and then just go straight up and make a line round the abandoned like a circle round the abandoned cottag.
*SPE0:	curve round the abandoned cottage and round the roo.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	back towards the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	right i've done that i've now got th-.
*SPE0:	and s-.
*SPE1:	i've now got three lines on my page but i know the one tha.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE1:	that will that would jus.
*SPE0:	it's meant to be a sort of continuous curve is it no.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	but i mean that that's like this is the third attempt sort of thin.
*SPE0:	oh right i se.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	well see where the abandoned cottage is now right you're at the roof of the abandoned co-.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	i'm above the chimne.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go down say about forty-five degrees on a sort of angl.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	dow.
*SPE0:	see where the fenced meadow is besi-- on the left-hand side of the r-- uh-huh the left-hand side of your pag.
*SPE1:	no m-- mine'.
*SPE0:	about halfway u.
*SPE1:	no that's not there on min.
*SPE0:	is it no.
*SPE1:	my fenced meadow's at the bottom right-hand sid.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	i've got two her.
*SPE0:	right eh.
*SPE1:	you've got two fenced meadow.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and no fores.
*SPE1:	and no fores.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE1:	i've gone round the forest in min.
*SPE0:	have yo.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	but i had to thoug.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE0:	may-- aye maybe that's what it is the.
*SPE0:	oh righ.
*SPE0:	see where the see where your caravan park is the.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	i've got nothing above it i've nothing above the caravan park 'til the the west lak.
*SPE0:	have you got something below i.
*SPE0:	have you got a ca-- have you got a fence below i.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	the picket fenc.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	did you go round i.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	i went over the mill the the picket fence er hasn't come into it right yet reall.
*SPE0:	di-.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	see the caravan par.
*SPE0:	i-- is there is there a picket fence underneath i.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	could you make a line go round it and then c-.
*SPE0:	is it bet-- is it like down and then the old mill's above from i.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	the the old mill's like northeast of i.
*SPE0:	so can you not go round the picket fence and round the old mill do you not have to go round the picket fence n.
*SPE1:	i don't think s.
*SPE1:	that that's what we did first of all th-- the the the first lin.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	when i was asking you whether i could you know i had to eh stop before i got to the picket fence or not so bu.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	do you not have to go round i.
*SPE1:	why it's just a fenc.
*SPE0:	it's it's not a picket fence here so the route must go round the picket fence surel.
*SPE1:	you think s.
*SPE1:	maybe it's the the route's to stay inside the picket fenc.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	maybe it is okay as long as you're on the picket fence then i don't kno.
*SPE1:	i've got one d-- i've got one i don't know realise why it's ther.
*SPE0:	right right you went by the abandoned cottage righ.
*SPE1:	i'm above the chimney just no.
*SPE0:	right you're above the chimne.
*SPE0:	and if you start going dow-- in an angle about forty-five degrees dow.
*SPE1:	mm mmhm.
*SPE0:	to the to where the bottom of the abandoned cottag.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	'til oh right s.
*SPE0:	you said you where are you no.
*SPE1:	the bottom of the abandoned cottag.
*SPE0:	right uh-hu.
*SPE0:	but wh-- is there anything on your map beside that then on your left-hand sid.
*SPE1:	no i've got noth-- no i've got nothing between the caravan park and the west lake on the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	can you make sort of like right if you make a sort o.
*SPE0:	if you make a sort of like a a forty-five degree angle right for about a couple of inches or something and then you start making a circle you know what if you know what i mean if you've got does a sort of angle then sort of curve roun.
*SPE0:	have you got a west lak.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	it's at the top lef.
*SPE0:	well can you can you make a sort of curve then if after your angle sort of like towards the west lak.
*SPE1:	a curv.
*SPE1:	whe-- where's your fenced meadow on the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	sort of like you've gon.
*SPE0:	m.
*SPE1:	where's your fenced meadow on the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	it's about halfway up the page that's wh-- uh-huh it's just about about halfway up the pag.
*SPE1:	so would you know head sort of for the west lake now avoiding you kno.
*SPE0:	so if you s-- imagine a fenced meadow in the middle of the pag.
*SPE0:	and you sort of make a circle round up towards the west lake you go up to the west lake and the.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	along the left-hand side of the pag.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	right up to the to.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	you go ri-- you make a a ci-- you make a line up go u.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	to the ti-- 'til you reach the west lak.
*SPE0:	see the curve in the at the bottom of the west lak.
*SPE1:	right yea.
*SPE0:	that sort of can you see a round curv.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	go to the the eh furthest point of that like in your left-hand side right about the bottom of that curv.
*SPE1:	yeah oka.
*SPE0:	and start curving round i.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	ti-- if you if you s-.
*SPE0:	can you see a trig poin.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE0:	right have you got the eh the west lak.
*SPE0:	so make a curve round the bottom of that curve right so just follow that curv.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	around west lake up to the just up to the point you kno.
*SPE0:	can you see on the west lake where it goes sort of straigh.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	on the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	no o.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	where's your trig poin.
*SPE1:	do you cross the lake or do you go round i.
*SPE0:	just just just go roun.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	until abou.
*SPE0:	trying to think wh-.
*SPE0:	see right can you no.
*SPE0:	see if there's a circle at the bottom know how you've just gone round i.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and you keep going up 'til about it's a kind of sh-- there's kind of angl.
*SPE0:	oh this is really har.
*SPE0:	see where the farmed land is at the to.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	but that's at the at the right-hand side of my west lak.
*SPE0:	uh-huh it's at the right-hand sid.
*SPE1:	yeah but i'm at the bottom left-hand side of the lake at the momen.
*SPE0:	right wel.
*SPE0:	so are you at the bottom left-han.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	i've just curved round the botto.
*SPE0:	and and you can cu-- you curve round the bottom and keep going up that curve just curve round tha.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so right round the top of the pag.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	that's a-- n.
*SPE1:	i'd have to otherwise i'd be in the lak.
*SPE0:	se-- can you see a monumen.
*SPE1:	the monument's on the right-hand sid.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	not all that far from the abandoned cottage in fac.
*SPE0:	uh-huh that's what i mea.
*SPE0:	and is the nuclear test site above i.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	i don't have a nuclear test sit.
*SPE1:	i've got a golf cours.
*SPE1:	have you got a golf cours.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	have you go.
*SPE1:	the golf course is just beneath the east lake about an inch or so dow.
*SPE0:	is i.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	up from its furthest poin.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	from eh okay it's about two inches down from where it says east lake in the lak.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	there's a golf course it's not that bi.
*SPE0:	so you want want you want to go round the golf course then i thin.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE1:	let's get round the lake first the west lak.
*SPE1:	s.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	i mean then then that's how i i'd need to go right round the to.
*SPE0:	i take it they're the same shape on the maps the.
*SPE1:	they must b.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	towards the top of the page unless i cross unless i cross the lake i'd need to go right round i.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	west lake isn't exac-.
*SPE0:	you don't want to cross the lak.
*SPE1:	but how am i going to get to the farmland or any-- or anything els.
*SPE0:	you don't want to go to the farmed lan.
*SPE0:	i just asked if i had if you had farmed lan.
*SPE1:	so i've to double back on mysel.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	so what do wher.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm at the bottom of west lak.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	where do i go no.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you you you curve roun.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see west lake you can see the curves can't you round west lak.
*SPE1:	along the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	on the left-hand side righ.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you've just come up from the abandoned cottage righ.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and you've gone straight u.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	to the bottom of west lak.
*SPE0:	see directly underneath it where it says west lak.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	o.
*SPE1:	i didn't actually i didn't actually go ther.
*SPE0:	see the see see whe-- west lake see where the "e" i.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	directly under that you can then you see a curve going round to your right it's like a sort of bottom of a circle or something it's quite it's quite rounde.
*SPE1:	yeah i know the i know the bit y-.
*SPE1:	the bottom right-hand side this is you're talking abou.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	you you talking about the "e" in lak.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oh god i forgot about tha.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you go down and just star.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see where the "e" in lake is right an.
*SPE0:	go down to the bottom of that start tracing around that then towards your righ.
*SPE1:	we're going right no.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	oh sorry have you been going right up the other sid.
*SPE1:	i thought we wer.
*SPE1:	i thought you were going lef.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	we're going righ.
*SPE1:	so we're going from the abandoned cottage to below where it says lak.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you've got you right you went to the abandoned cottage and you did a sort of circl.
*SPE1:	right i've done that no.
*SPE1:	and i and then i trace it back roun.
*SPE1:	right okay i'm doing that no.
*SPE0:	uh-huh you ar.
*SPE0:	and you're going roun.
*SPE1:	around the bottom right-hand corner oka.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	round the curve and then u.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	round that curve and then u.
*SPE0:	and you don't have a trig poin.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	i've got all these lines on my on my map no.
*SPE0:	see ehm where you've curved up from west lake do you know where i'm talking about see how there's a kind of sharp turn to the lef.
*SPE1:	that don't appl.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	in west lak.
*SPE1:	at the top of the lak.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	and then you go down there's a kind of a bit you go straight down and then you go back up agai.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	if you can follow thi.
*SPE0:	right so you've went round the corner righ.
*SPE0:	start agai.
*SPE1:	the bottom right oka.
*SPE0:	and see wh-- how i just said how it goes straight up and it goes down and it goes u.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	see that bit that goes u.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	the first tim.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	sort of sharp bi.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	stop following the curve at the bottom of tha.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	and see when you get to tha.
*SPE0:	do an angle follow tha.
*SPE0:	see that sort of straight angl.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	do a straight line going to your towards your your right down to the left-hand side you're going dow.
*SPE1:	down to the right to my left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE0:	if d-- if you think of a compass so if it would be your ehm eh southwes.
*SPE1:	but i'd be in the lake the.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	you wouldn't be in the lake you shouldn'.
*SPE1:	i stop drawing the curve righ.

*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	what bit of east lake do i go up t.
*SPE0:	just go straight up to east lake when you've curved round the monument and where the golf course'll be sort of curv.
*SPE1:	i can imagin.
*SPE1:	see where the see where th.
*SPE0:	nuclear test site i.
*SPE1:	the the left-hand side of the east lake at the bottom righ.
*SPE1:	if you draw a straight line down there that's the edge of the golf course so i can't go any i can't you kno.
*SPE0:	to the left-hand side of east lake like the very far end of east lak.
*SPE1:	i can'.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	at the botto.
*SPE1:	i can't go any further left sorry further right than that because i've been i c-- i'd need to go through the golf course so i've actually you know that's where i am now more or less been-- beneath that point because that's the like th.

*SPE1:	i i'm at the finish no.
*SPE0:	are you sure right that you've went up oh right and you've we-- you've gone up towards east lake and then turned then went to your right just followed the curve round east lake t-.

*SPE0:	you talking about the bottom righ.
*SPE1:	the bottom lef.
*SPE0:	you've just reached ther.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	but you're supposed to curve underneath there to about halfway you're meant to like sort of draw a line following that line to about halfway and then go down round past the monument past your golf course i think as wel.
*SPE0:	maybe you go round your golf cours.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE1:	i've already gone round i.

*SPE0:	eh wel.
*SPE0:	just a centimetre past it right to your lef.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i'd ha-- i'd have to go up between the golf course and the nuclear test sit.
*SPE0:	right that's finish point s.
*SPE0:	so i take it that must be another s-- they must be between each othe.
*SPE0:	the line should be between that the.
*SPE1:	between the golf course and the nuclear test sit.
*SPE0:	it's the golf course right it's underneath east lake and it's eh northwest from the monumen.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	yeah mmhm.
*SPE0:	so have you gone round it as in have you gone round it on the right-hand sid.
*SPE1:	the left-hand sid.
*SPE1:	so i've i've to go round it on the right-hand sid.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	you've you come to the monument and you go round it the golf course trac.
*SPE1:	i so i've just i've just to pass the left-hand side of the nuclear test sit.
*SPE0:	mmhmm mmhm.
*SPE1:	right okay n.
*SPE0:	have you got a nuclear test sit.
*SPE1:	but i-- you told me it was just below ea-- east lak.

*SPE0:	e.
*SPE1:	so i go left now i take i.

*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	one centimetre to the lef.
*SPE0:	uh-huh yea.
*SPE0:	right that's the ve-- the finish poin.
*SPE0:	of east lake have you traced under the east lak.
