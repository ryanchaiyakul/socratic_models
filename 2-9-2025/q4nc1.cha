*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i've no g-- i've not got any tribal settlement at all and other than that i've got an extinct volcano and that's heading down toward.
*SPE0:	y-- you've not got a t-.
*SPE0:	you've not go.
*SPE1:	the bottom of the pag.
*SPE0:	you've not got to the left-hand side a tribal settlemen.
*SPE1:	no i haven'.
*SPE0:	well you're going to go down about three centimetres down to where it the word says extinct volcan.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	then you're going to start going along wes.
*SPE1:	west right okay fo.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	keep on going until you're maybe about three centimetres from the the left-hand side of the pag.
*SPE1:	from the left-hand s-.
*SPE1:	that's quite a bi.
*SPE0:	uh-huh it's quite far alon.
*SPE0:	'ka.
*SPE0:	so just about three in-- three centimetres from the left-hand sid.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	then you're going to start going up nort.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	have you got a rope bridg.
*SPE1:	i have just up to sort o.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	so if you start just drawing drawing a line up towards the rope bridg.
*SPE1:	up towards going diagonally across to the rope bridg.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	just going up then veering off to the right up to the rope bridg.
*SPE1:	'ka.
*SPE0:	then you're going to go across the rope bridg.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	so i draw a line through the rope bridg.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	you're going to go through tha.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	the end of the rope bridg.
*SPE0:	you're at the end of the rope bridg.
*SPE0:	now if you go down not very steeply but just ehm down south a bi.
*SPE1:	down righ.
*SPE0:	about about another three centimetres just a gradual slope dow.
*SPE1:	gradual sort of south through eas.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	uh-huh slope to the eas.
*SPE0:	aye south to east slope down about three centimetre.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	so now you want to go eas.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	straight acros.
*SPE1:	just a straight line eas.
*SPE0:	just a straight lin.

*SPE1:	yes i have that's a-.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you're going to go along until you're underneath the collapsed shelte.
*SPE1:	right i'll be underneath it by about two or three centimetre.
*SPE0:	bu.
*SPE0:	uh-huh just a little below the "o" actuall.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	then you're going to start going up north agai.

*SPE1:	have you not got a crevass.
*SPE0:	i've not got a crevass.
*SPE1:	no oka.
*SPE1:	for about ten centimetre.
*SPE0:	uh-huh ten centimetres straight up nort.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then you're going to actually you're not just going to go ehm when you go st-- you're going to go back west again but if you actually kind of go up a wee bit then diagonally down know what i mean like in a wee hum.

*SPE1:	diagonal line which wa.
*SPE0:	sorry ehm to th.
*SPE1:	s-- east wes.
*SPE0:	to the wes.
*SPE1:	left righ.
*SPE0:	to the wes.

*SPE0:	for about three centimetres so you're kind of l-.
*SPE0:	uh-huh this is towards the edge of the pape.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	so you're making another little kind of you're making a wee pit and now you're going to go back up agai.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	you're going to go up north well this is quite a long way this time about about twelve centimetres right up north up the side of the pag.
*SPE1:	jus.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	and have you got a white mountai.
*SPE1:	so are we about a third down the page at the momen.
*SPE0:	aye we're about a third down the pag.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and you're going to go up to about two thirds up the page with this lin.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	the top of the white i've got a white mountain ye.
*SPE0:	oh you've got the white mountai.
*SPE1:	i have got the white on.

*SPE0:	like if you just kind of like veer your line as though you're going up the moun-- the white mountai.
*SPE1:	up up the side of it righ.
*SPE0:	uh-huh up the side of the white mountai.
*SPE1:	okay and when i get t.
*SPE0:	and right once you reach the top of the white mountai.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	with your line just continue straight up nort.
*SPE0:	have you got a golden beac.
*SPE1:	golden beac.
*SPE1:	i've not n.
*SPE0:	well the golden beach is about six centimetres up so if yo.
*SPE1:	so is this directly just a straight lin.
*SPE0:	this is direct-.
*SPE0:	this is directly up nort.
*SPE0:	a straight line up to the golden beac.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	from the top of the white mountai.
*SPE0:	from the top of the white mountain right u.
*SPE1:	how f-- how far u.
*SPE0:	ehm about six centimetres 'til you're about ah 'til you're about ehm about the same distance away from you're about five centimetres six centimetres from the top of the page no.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	to the left-hand side of the pag.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and now we're going to go a complete straight line ehm eas.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	for about six centimetres again 'cause if yo.
*SPE1:	right have you got a slate mountai.
*SPE0:	ah th-.
*SPE0:	right 'til it's just the bottom of slate mountain that'll be the.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	and see how you what you did with the white mountain eh.
*SPE1:	what i did with the white mountai.
*SPE0:	you you just went up the sid.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE1:	go up the side of i.
*SPE0:	well look as though you're going to climb the up to the top of the slate mountai.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	then come back down the other side missing the wee seagull.
*SPE1:	right so that right that's what i'm doing oh right oh oka.
*SPE1:	right down the side missing the seagull.

*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	right have you got a secret valle.
*SPE1:	eh yes i hav.
*SPE1:	that's that's down below the slate mountain ye.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	about ten centimetres twelve centimetre.
*SPE0:	right w-.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	what you're going to do is like you're at the bottom of slate mountain and you're going to g-- actually go ehm you're going to go west like underneath the slate mountai.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	going a wee bit diagonally not a completely straight lin.
*SPE0:	do you know what i mea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.

*SPE0:	round to the left-hand side of the page agai.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	that'd be wes.
*SPE0:	and then once you reach about the as though the the bottom of the slate mountain again you're going to go competely down to the bottom of the secret valle.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	dir-- just directly dow.
*SPE0:	just directly dow.
*SPE1:	straight dow.
*SPE1:	to the secret valle.
*SPE0:	uh-huh just to the bottom of the where it says secret valle.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	and then can you see you just draw a straight line to the finis.
*SPE1:	to the finish n.
*SPE1:	i've not got a finis.
*SPE0:	well the finish is actuall.
*SPE0:	you know where it says secret valle.
*SPE0:	it's just about a centimetre along from that and down a wee bit that's where the f-.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	from the edge of the letter "y.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	it's about a centimetre along from the letter "y" and about a centimetre down that's your finishing cros.
*SPE1:	centim-.
*SPE1:	right oka.
