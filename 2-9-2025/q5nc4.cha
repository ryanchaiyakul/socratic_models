*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	you're going to go down slightly to the right just slightly in sort of ehm in a curve shape an outward curve curve shape from the cliff.
*SPE1:	m.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	no.
*SPE1:	where do i go from the star.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you're going to go dow.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	but just slightly down and slightly to the righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	so i go underneath the cliff.
*SPE0:	so you're get going to get a curve shap.
*SPE0:	uh-huh a-.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	curve at the cliff.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	have you got a forg.
*SPE1:	ehm n.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	come to the lef.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i go underneath the cliff.
*SPE0:	no don't go underneath the cliff.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	no no n.
*SPE0:	it's like a backward "s" shape you're formin.
*SPE1:	mm yeah think i kno.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	yeah oka.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	at at the bottom of the sort of backward "s.
*SPE0:	have you got that fa.
*SPE1:	i don't kno.
*SPE0:	right okay righ.
*SPE0:	from the start you're going to go down slightly to the right and form a curve an outward curv.
*SPE1:	to the right to the right oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	thank.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE0:	you're going to do the opposite of that you're going to go ou.
*SPE0:	further to the lef.
*SPE1:	m.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	no.
*SPE1:	i've got an old pine her.
*SPE0:	come back an old pine an old pin.
*SPE1:	what do i do in relation to i.
*SPE1:	oh and you don't have i.
*SPE0:	right eh.
*SPE0:	is the old pine at the the bottom of the curve or sort of next to i.
*SPE1:	the old pine is ehm underneath an.
*SPE0:	underneath the curv.
*SPE1:	to the to the right of the cliff.
*SPE0:	really eh.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	forget the old pin.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	well you're going to go round the old pin.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	am .
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	bu.
*SPE1:	a.
*SPE0:	go round the old pin.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	wh-- righ.
*SPE1:	what am i going above it or wha.
*SPE0:	above i.
*SPE0:	above i.
*SPE0:	straight above it righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	go slightl.
*SPE0:	let me se.
*SPE0:	ehm going to go to the left go slightly to the left and you're going to curve down just a slightly go about f-- about ehm five centimetre.
*SPE1:	now where am i no.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	don't know where i a.
*SPE0:	go five centimetre.
*SPE0:	are you near a pine fores.
*SPE1:	eh yeah i can se.
*SPE1:	the pine fores.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go sort of like slightly just parallel to the pine forest but about three centimetres out from i.
*SPE1:	m.
*SPE1:	so i go over to the pine forest and then go dow.
*SPE0:	no no no righ.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go to the point where you'r.
*SPE0:	see the top of the pine fores.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	the top of it righ.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	you're going to go to the left right you should be at the left of it right and paralle-- parallel to i.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	are you ther.
*SPE1:	ehm think s.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE1:	oh dea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	ca-- you're going to slope down and it's going to b.
*SPE0:	oh let me see how i could explain tha.
*SPE0:	at about five o-.
*SPE0:	say how like at five o'clock you'll have a small hand with the small hand sort of like darting down towards the fiv.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go down that that way to the bottom of pine forest at a slan.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	uh-huh yea.
*SPE0:	right no.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	you're going to form another outward curve like half a circl.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	just do sort of like a small half circle to your sort of like ehm a quarter down the pag.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	so where am i headin.
*SPE0:	right are you ne-- a-.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	are y-- you near a baker.
*SPE1:	eh yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go right round that baker.
*SPE1:	round the bakery m.
*SPE0:	round the baker.
*SPE1:	go.
*SPE1:	what wa.
*SPE0:	ehm go out out out the wa.
*SPE1:	out the way s.
*SPE0:	towards the towards the th-- ehm the edge of the pag.
*SPE1:	mm oh dea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	have you got a forest strea.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	what about wheatfield.
*SPE0:	i have wheatfields righ.
*SPE1:	right the way ove.
*SPE1:	yeah no.
*SPE1:	where am i going in relation to the.
*SPE0:	should be nowhere near the.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	well i'm not so fa.
*SPE0:	have yo.
*SPE0:	have you got a cana.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	but i've got a forest strea.
*SPE0:	now righ.
*SPE0:	you're round the bakery you're round the bakery aren't yo.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	because i've got a forest stream in the way oh my good go.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	you can't go round the baker.
*SPE1:	ehm i'll make my way round the stream here oh dea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	right i think s.
*SPE0:	go round the baker.
*SPE1:	m.
*SPE0:	right round it and just pass i-- pass it erm a small fractio.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	as wel.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you're going to go straight down this time for about four centimetre.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	you're going to form another slight curve ehm another circle but you're going to do it ehm ehm convex towards the page like outward an outward you're forming the outward ehm form of a circle here a minut.
*SPE0:	no mmhm.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go go ehm three centimetres to the left again no wait a minute where are we three centimetres to the righ.
*SPE1:	i'm going to go off the edge of the page her.
*SPE0:	right are you near wheatfield.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	no righ.
*SPE0:	go back 'til you're sort of like middle of the page righ.
*SPE1:	right m.
*SPE0:	but down slightly but you're sort of still in the middle of the pag.
*SPE0:	are you near crane ba.
*SPE1:	mm yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	what do i do ther.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see the second peak of crane ba.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	that's where you should b.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	i'm not ther.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	retrace all your steps and go go to ther.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	forget tha.
*SPE0:	right no.
*SPE0:	is is there wheatfields nea.
*SPE1:	er right wait a minut.
*SPE1:	i go round the the far side of the bakery and then head towards the s-- second peak of crane ba.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	shi-- right sort of trace that sort of ehm bevelled shape in crane crane bay and you want to get to the second peak of crane ba.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	eh yeah i think so i'm getting ther.
*SPE0:	the one that's towards the righ.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	follow that curve of crane bay down for about three centimetre.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	are you near wheatfield.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	my wheatfields are on the middle of the pag.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	that's that's okay that's okay righ.
*SPE0:	go go along for another three centimetre.
*SPE1:	have you got a rocket warehous.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	no.
*SPE1:	where am i supposed to b.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you're supposed to be just above the rocket warehous.
*SPE1:	just above i.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i go down and then alon.
*SPE1:	right i go down from crane ba.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	and then acros.
*SPE0:	just you should be just above rocket warehous.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	uh-huh think s.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	head t-- down towards your right at a slan.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE0:	you should be near enough at the edge of the pag.
*SPE1:	erm oh dear oh dea.
*SPE1:	ehm oh dear eh.
*SPE0:	you're about an in-.
*SPE1:	i'm still at the left of the rocket warehous.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you're at the left of the rocket ehm rocket warehous.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	i'm abov.
*SPE0:	abov.
*SPE1:	and at the left of the rocket warehous.
*SPE0:	abov.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go straight down to a slant 'til you're near enough just a centimetre away from the edge of the pag.
*SPE1:	mm right oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	hope s.
*SPE0:	go down by another three centimetre.
*SPE1:	o.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE0:	tut.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE0:	trying to thin.
*SPE1:	have you got an old lighthous.
