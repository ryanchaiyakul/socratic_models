*SPE1:	what wa.
*SPE0:	directly sout.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	say you kno.
*SPE1:	how far is that how far south before i make a camel's hum.
*SPE0:	the nor-.
*SPE0:	just just on your way south make a little hum.
*SPE0:	and go down about oh three inche.
*SPE1:	lik.
*SPE1:	how big's the hump lik.
*SPE0:	just like a wee little like a little hil.
*SPE1:	ay.
*SPE1:	but how-- how bi-- how long a on.
*SPE0:	just like the well the three inch line going south should just be like a little just have a little a hump t.
*SPE1:	a curve a curvy lin.
*SPE0:	it doe.
*SPE0:	pardon yeah yea.
*SPE0:	sort of j-- well well just with one but i d-- i guess it doesn't matter so just go down south about three inche.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	then g.
*SPE1:	one tw.
*SPE0:	east about two inche.
*SPE1:	eas.
*SPE0:	m.
*SPE1:	that's right isn't i.
*SPE0:	and then g.
*SPE0:	or maybe no just go east about one inc.
*SPE1:	oh shit no n.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE1:	does it go through any obstacle.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	we're trying to avoid on.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE1:	i think righ.
*SPE0:	there so what we want to do now well we should have gon.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE1:	one and a half inches along that would be bette.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	u.
*SPE1:	to the lef.
*SPE0:	we'll se.
*SPE0:	okay becaus.
*SPE1:	to the right i mea.

*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	right okay that's don.
*SPE0:	but s.
*SPE0:	now we want to go um diagonally northeast and sort of avoid the obstacle on the right so you should be on the outside of tha.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	have you got a name written on i.
*SPE1:	that wee obstacl.
*SPE0:	c-.
*SPE0:	carpente.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	so have .
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	and so no.

*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	n-- that's different in min.
*SPE0:	okay anyway s-.
*SPE1:	right wait a minute right hang on righ.
*SPE1:	diagonal sort of lik.
*SPE0:	north yea.
*SPE1:	northeast diagona.
*SPE1:	how lon.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	about two inches mayb.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	i don't know really inches that wel.
*SPE1:	well yeah just sort of roughl.
*SPE1:	right okay that'.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	now we want to go to the right which is to the eas.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE1:	along to some trees maybe roughl.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	well we want to of this is what i okay well let's se.
*SPE0:	we want to go st-- east east about two inche.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then sort of slope down about two inches and approach the left of these tree.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	to sort of cut from above the trees to cut in to the left of the.
*SPE0:	to to come in belo.
*SPE0:	yeah yeah the left of the tree.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE1:	how how long do you want that diagonal to b.
*SPE0:	ah wel.
*SPE0:	it has to go east right about two inches and then come down about an inch and a hal.
*SPE1:	right an inch and a hal.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	it it doesn't go directly from it's sort of like more like a slop.
*SPE1:	s.
*SPE1:	almost like half a "zed" shap.
*SPE1:	you know like a z-- letter "zed.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	right okay i've done tha.
*SPE0:	you mean "zee.
*SPE1:	yeah i mean "zed.

*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	and a.
*SPE1:	oh tree.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	there were trees that we jus.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	got by and no.
*SPE1:	i'.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE1:	i'm not quite beyond well i'm just about bo-- at the bottom of the.
*SPE0:	yeah yea.
*SPE0:	that's exactly where you should b.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	but now is there something even be-- right below the tree.
*SPE1:	no there isn'.
*SPE0:	okay wel.
*SPE1:	there's a there's a bit a couple of bits down called field.
*SPE0:	yeah that's we're above there we're halfwa.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	we're right at the bottom of the trees righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and what we want to do i.
*SPE1:	so i'm picking my nose kara shit righ.
*SPE1:	carry on sorr.
*SPE0:	what we want to d.
*SPE1:	right i com.
*SPE0:	is make like alrigh.
*SPE0:	say you're at the bottom of the seven beeche.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	you want to take your index finger and do like a semicircle right from there to the top of the fields just like a sort of .
*SPE1:	like a big curve lik.
*SPE0:	yeah yea.
*SPE0:	a s-- eh half a curve thoug.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	just so it's like a curve to the right and it's only tha.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	like if it like 'cause i'm left handed like if i put my hand on that and just swiveled my hand right roun.
*SPE0:	and s-.
*SPE0:	if you put your left index finger and just go to the righ.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	and it's like a half semicircle half circl.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	okay so no.
*SPE0:	we're at the to.
*SPE1:	to to right above the t-- th-- the field.
*SPE0:	fields yea.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	and then lik.
*SPE0:	say say you put your thum.
*SPE1:	so so yeah sorr.
*SPE0:	put your left thumb right over the fields and then trace around i.
*SPE1:	wha.
*SPE0:	put put y-.
*SPE1:	bend i.
*SPE1:	no i'm left handed so it'd be my right thum.
*SPE0:	no n.
*SPE0:	your left i'm doing it with my left han.
*SPE1:	oh righ.
*SPE1:	how h-- h-.
*SPE0:	put oka.
*SPE0:	put your put your left thumb just so the tip of your thumb is facing right is facing eas.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and then just put it over the fields and then like trace around your thumb 'til the base or 'til the base of the thumb where it connects to the rest of the han.
*SPE1:	bu.
*SPE1:	what what bit how do you mea.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE1:	i cannae do it with my left hand thoug.
*SPE0:	why no.
*SPE1:	cannae draw it with my left hand 'cause my thumb my left-hand thumb's on the on the bit of pape.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	just well just use the right thing 'cause all you need to do is trace around your thum.
*SPE1:	will it not go through the field.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	it should be you sh-- your thumb should be directly on the fields and then you should be going around i.
*SPE1:	well it's the fiel-.
*SPE1:	s.
*SPE1:	it's like just like tracing round the fields reall.
*SPE0:	yeah yea.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	and then to where the bas.
*SPE0:	ah your hands are much smaller than min.
*SPE1:	what way do you want me to trace round the fields it goes right round the fields like takes a right round the field.
*SPE0:	yeah you go right around the field.
*SPE0:	and then you go left again to the base of your thum.
*SPE1:	right okay right i'm just doing that no.
*SPE0:	'cause it looks like it looks like a hand sort of well my thumb's a lot bigger than your.
*SPE1:	god i didn't realise my thumb was such a funny shap.
*SPE1:	yeah right it's okay we've handled it i thin.
*SPE0:	okay s.
*SPE0:	no.

*SPE0:	alright u.
*SPE0:	now we want to go due sout.
*SPE0:	for about two inche.
*SPE1:	u.
*SPE0:	and come right along to the edge of the ba.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then s-.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	right to the edge of the ba.
*SPE0:	yeah like abou.
*SPE1:	touching the ba.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	just like leaving a wee spac.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	in betwee.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE0:	does the bay sort of slope down to the lef.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE1:	there's a it's li-- li-- there's a almost like a wee headland right where i'm coming down there's it's like a flat bit of the bay right and if you move to your left it's all like a headland jutting out into the bay like a a shallow curv.
*SPE0:	yo.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	going into the ba.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	just trace along that curv.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	'til you come to the next wee poin.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	where it sort of 'cause then then like the bay drops dow.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	just where the bay drops down stop ther.
*SPE1:	right okay i've done tha.
*SPE0:	okay and no.
*SPE1:	uh-u.
*SPE0:	what we want to do is like a little waterfall sort o.
*SPE0:	lik.
*SPE0:	do you hav.
*SPE1:	wha.
*SPE0:	directly to your left do you have like cliffs and with a meadow on top of i.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	i've got attractive cliffs at the bottom of th-.
*SPE1:	see where the bay goes dow.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	it the it's at the bottom ther.
*SPE0:	and then do you have anything ahead of it on top o.
*SPE1:	not above it no nothin.
*SPE0:	that oka.
*SPE1:	there's a big empty space s.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	v-- but that oka.
*SPE0:	what there is a meadow up there s.
*SPE1:	oh i've go-- i've got vast meadows but it's about six inches above i.
*SPE0:	okay n.
*SPE0:	i have something that you don't the.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	but so 'cause there's another vast meadow about an inch up from the attractive cliff.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	we need to go in between the attractive cliffs and this meadow so like slope down to th.
*SPE1:	s.
*SPE1:	what about going across this drop in the bay the.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	what you do go left at gentle slope 'til you're about a half an inch above the attractive cliffs and go straight to the left above them so a gentle slope down 'til the right of the attractive cliff.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	and then just straight lef.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	just straight left for about an inch and a hal.
*SPE1:	right i think i've done that righ.
*SPE0:	and then another gentle slope down to the left about an inch lon.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	or inch and a hal.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	i'm getting near the end of the edge of the paper thoug.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	ah okay oh are yo.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	okay because alright s-.
*SPE1:	have you got a crashed spaceship down ther.
*SPE1:	just below the attractive cliff.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	all i have is a chestnut tre.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	i've got a chestnut tree right i've got attractive cliffs and then und-- straight underneath tha.
*SPE0:	you have a spaceshi.
*SPE1:	ha i've got a chestnut tree right so d-- but on the left-hand side between the two that's where the spaceship i.
*SPE0:	on the left of the chestnut tre.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	see see the attractive cliffs and chestnut tree are sort of in a straight well not really a straight line but one under the othe.
*SPE0:	yeah yea.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	you've got a crashed space crashed spaceship on the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	'cause that's where we're su-- is do you have a f-- an that's where we're supposed to finis.
*SPE1:	oh righ.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	what you do if you're at the edge of the paper just drop down abou.
*SPE1:	i'm not at the edge i've g-- i've got about an inch and a half to go i'.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	just above i've just come through the attractive cliff.
*SPE0:	m.
*SPE1:	bi.
*SPE0:	oke-- okay so another like very very slight slope to the left 'til you're about like a half uh a quarter of an inch away from the pape.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then you drop down about an inch and a hal.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	then you go to the right about an inc.
*SPE0:	and a little bloop u.
*SPE1:	wha.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	then you just go bloop and like about tiny tiny bit up and draw an "x" and we're done it should be right to the left of the chestnut tre.
*SPE1:	o.
*SPE0:	you're making me pick my nos.
*SPE1:	well we we might be in di-- the chestnut trees might be in different positio.
*SPE1:	is it a bloop like a kind of round bi.
*SPE0:	yeah jus.
*SPE1:	like what we did round the field.
*SPE0:	sort of but very very j-.
*SPE1:	earlier o.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	it's like it's so slight it's only like it's less than a quarter of an inch 'cause you just came t.
*SPE1:	what to the left or to the righ.
*SPE0:	just straight u.
*SPE1:	straight u.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	i guess it doesn't matte.
*SPE1:	i'm coming right wait a minut.
*SPE1:	i'm coming down the way right i've come across sort of diagonally in a curve past the cliff cliffs and i've dropped down about half an inc.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	just over half an inch three quarters of an inch righ.
*SPE0:	so how f-- ho.
*SPE1:	where do and i'm just above the spaceship righ.
*SPE0:	okay s.
*SPE1:	so where do you want do you want me to bloop round this round what i've go.
*SPE0:	is the eh is the spaceship right to the left of the tre.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	it's just above the tre.
*SPE0:	oh no you should be y-.
*SPE1:	it's above it's well my tree might be different than your tre.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	well just jus.
*SPE0:	go to the right about an inch and then draw an "x" and we'll be don.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	i got to see your ma.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	it's great yea.
