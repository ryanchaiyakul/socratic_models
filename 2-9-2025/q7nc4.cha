*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	the start point's at about a half an inch above i.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	okay righ.
*SPE0:	oh righ.
*SPE0:	what we need to do right is like e.
*SPE0:	above that you've roughly well above and to a wee bit to the left you've got s-- a poison stream is that righ.
*SPE1:	eh n.
*SPE1:	i've got nothing above it i've got an old temple to my right of i.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	have you got anything to-- more to the left at al.
*SPE1:	a footbridge quite a bit ove.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE0:	right we need to go t-- right what we need to do is like see the crest falls we need to go like we start just above it and we move to the eh.
*SPE0:	i'll explain it to you right firs.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	move to the left about an inch and then drop down like almost at the side of the fall.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	it goes into a curve d-- goes along the bottom of the page right to about an inch before the edge of the page and it curves right round it's almost like a kind of square circle and it cuts along and it goes it goes up level with the footbridge and goes along the footbridg.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	goes along the foot bridge to the side o.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	like as if you're walking along the footbridg.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	and then it jus-.
*SPE1:	what about the banana tree does it come before the banana tre.
*SPE0:	o.
*SPE0:	i don't have a banana tre.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	where's the banana tree roughl.
*SPE1:	it's just below the footbridge and along to my left slightl.
*SPE0:	i.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	it's level with the cr-- the fall.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE0:	well w-- what we want to kind of go round that the round the outside of that one a massive big curv.
*SPE1:	round the outside of it right oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	then back along level with the footbridg.
*SPE0:	right you ju-- if you go right to the footbridg.
*SPE0:	just sort aye if you if you thin.
*SPE1:	do you want me to start drawing this o.
*SPE1:	just yeah oka.
*SPE0:	if its alright righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	down to the side of the crest fall.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	just ri-- right down to the bottom of it reall.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	along the bottom and then curve up right round past banana tre.
*SPE1:	right underneath the footbridge right and alon.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	right up to the point level with the footbridg.
*SPE1:	yeah i'm parallel with the footbridge no.
*SPE1:	below it or above it sorry should i b.
*SPE0:	eh well you actually need to go across i.
*SPE0:	right yeah as i.
*SPE1:	oh i'm going along the footbridg.
*SPE1:	right sorry oka.
*SPE0:	you're walking along i.
*SPE0:	is that oka.
*SPE1:	yeah sorr.
*SPE0:	right see once you've come like if you stop just at the side of the foo-- just at the other edge of the footbridg.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	and we've got a poisoned stream right next to that on the right-hand sid.
*SPE0:	so we need to drop down about an inch and a half straight down after the footbridg.
*SPE1:	straight dow.
*SPE0:	yeah straight dow.
*SPE0:	'cause it's right next to it as if we're dropped down between i.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	eh drop down about an inch inch and a hal.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then we need to eh go to your your right about two or three inche.
*SPE1:	along to the side of the old temple but below i.
*SPE0:	yeah now we'r.
*SPE0:	what's with the old temple right we're going to curve up like ehm curve to go straight up like just before the old templ.
*SPE1:	before the old templ.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	so you're like glancing round it so you just go go in a curve dow.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so straight across to the old temple and then up a par.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	but if you make it a curve instead of like a ti-- a sort of tight angle ther.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and go about an inch above the old temple just going straight u.
*SPE1:	to the side of the straight the slate mountain oka.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	to the left-hand side of the old templ.
*SPE1:	right an inch above it did you sa.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	aye about tha.
*SPE0:	right e.
*SPE0:	there's a kind of hum.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	have you got see to the left of where you are right have you got an abandoned truck a good bit to the lef.
*SPE1:	between th-.
*SPE1:	yeah i hav.
*SPE1:	but before that i've got a slate mountai.
*SPE0:	right wel.
*SPE0:	i've got a massive big hump here so i i presume that goes round the str-- s-- round the top of the slate mountai.
*SPE1:	yeah and righ.
*SPE0:	if you want to draw like draw a curve round the top of the slate mountain and go down underneath the abandoned truc.
*SPE1:	far underneath it or just underneath i.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	just underneath the writin.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	okay and stop just at the end of the writing abandoned truc.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	have you got down to your bottom left-hand side of where you are a baboon.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	i don't have anythin.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	what we oh heck it's right there's a there's this kind of group of baboons right which is right near the edge but we need to kind of go down underneath them and along to about a half an inch before the edge of the page and then up again so it's like a cup-shape.
*SPE0:	thing reall.
*SPE1:	sorry how far am i going down t.
*SPE0:	you're going down about an inch below the abandoned truc.
*SPE1:	unde.
*SPE0:	right see righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	you're underneath the abandoned truck just no.
*SPE1:	the truc.
*SPE1:	just like a pr-.
*SPE0:	is that righ.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	and you need to sort of curve straight down to about an about an inch just over an inch below that and straight down a-- and sort of round along for about an inch and then up for about an inch so it's like a cup-shape.
*SPE1:	along to the end of the pag.
*SPE0:	to the lef.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	and just before the paper say about a half an inch before the paper curve up agai.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	right s.
*SPE0:	have you got quite a couple of inches above that a thing called white mountai.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	now we sort of gently slope to the right from where we are up to the left-hand side of the white mountain so you sort o.
*SPE1:	above going above the left of the mountain or underneath i.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	just along the side of it along the left-hand side of the mountai.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	and then after you to-- the top of the mountain you go straight up for three inche.
*SPE1:	straight up towards the lemon grov.
*SPE0:	well i don't have a lemon onl.
*SPE1:	right we need to avoid that 'cause that's straight above the white mountain it's about two to three inches above i.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	well maybe go ab-- right if y-- if you avoid that and once you get to the top of that turn right like a sort of right angle turning to the right if you see what i mea.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	to my right yea.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and about two and a half inches along from there th-- have you got a pyrami.
*SPE1:	pyramid yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	we have to go round the outside of the pyramid but you go up-- up the left-hand side down the right-hand side and underneath it right so we're almost doing a triangl.
*SPE1:	up and over righ.
*SPE0:	but underneath that we've got a cobbled stree.
*SPE0:	have you got tha.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	i've got a poisoned stream near ther.
*SPE0:	oh no like my poisoned stream's a lot more to the right but i've got a cobbled street right underneath the pyrami.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	right s.
*SPE0:	have you have you drawn round the pyramid ye.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	i've drawn up above it and then down below agai.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	if you could go along back to your left right to the end of the pyrami.
*SPE1:	back to my lef.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	so it's almost as if you're drawing right round it but not quit.
*SPE1:	so like a triangl.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	yeah uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	right excuse me coughing righ.
*SPE0:	we've got have you got a remote village further dow.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	quite a bit dow.
*SPE0:	right okay no.
*SPE0:	what we have to do is sort of veer to the left just a wee bit going straight down so that you come down underneath the remote village right and once you get to th.
*SPE0:	you know on the left-hand side of i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	and then what we need to do is turn turn right straight right f-- just 'til you're other side of the remote village and then that's us don.
*SPE1:	right i'm down to the side of i.
*SPE1:	underneath the poisoned stream sort of roughl.
*SPE0:	well eh mine's is in a different position than yours s.
*SPE0:	aye probably if yours i.
*SPE1:	so the right-hand side of my right-hand side of the remote village is where we end yea.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	but you come round the left-hand side underneath it and along to your righ.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	so i'm sort of directly above the old temple is where i finis.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	roughly just yeah say maybe just just short of tha.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	yeah wel.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	just short of it oka.
