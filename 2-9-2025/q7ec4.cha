*SPE0:	until you've just got past the edge of the crest fall.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE0:	come down until you reach a an angle maybe just past south towards west slightly past until you reach the bottom of crest falls and le-- a level with the "c" and maybe about an inch to west of the "c.
*SPE1:	m.
*SPE1:	okey-doke.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then go due west until about two centimetres from the edge of the pape.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	do you have a footbridg.
*SPE1:	n-- just north of the banana tre.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go up north now until you're just due north until you're just below the the level of the footbridg.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and then from there go over right to the edge of the the the western side of footbridg.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then the path s-- the path starts again at the other side of the footbridg.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	do you have a poisoned stream ther.
*SPE1:	no not at al.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	just at the the footbridge next to when you come off there's a poisoned strea.
*SPE0:	so when you come off the footbridge you have to go due south maybe about an inch and a hal.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE0:	och t-- take a wee bit more to be safe just a wee touch mor.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and then do you have an old templ.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go along eastward for about two inche.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and then curve up until you're at the bottom of the old templ.
*SPE1:	rightee-h.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	go up about two and a half inche.
*SPE0:	do you have anything above the old temple in that area up ther.
*SPE1:	nothin.
*SPE1:	up until a poisoned strea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	what about do you have an abandoned truc.
*SPE1:	what way to the left of i.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	is there anything between the old temple and the truc.
*SPE1:	eh slate mountai.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	i don't have tha.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE0:	loo-- go two and a half inches up over the temple the up the side of i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE0:	and then say an angle of northwest forty-five degree.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	go up for about two inches that would probably take you past the top of th.
*SPE1:	up past the truck and the mountai.
*SPE0:	something uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then b-- back down at the same angle to well the opposite angle anyway to get you down to th-- your abandoned truck just below i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then go straight across the bottom of the abandoned truc.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	until you're just below the "a.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	have you got baboon.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	now come due sout.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	about an inch and a half to an inch and three quarter.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE0:	due west for about two inche.
*SPE0:	uh the.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	do you have a white mountain further u.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	well the best thing to do first of all would be come back up to where you were at the "a" and the come up to make that a "u" shap.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE0:	draw a line straight between this point and maybe about half a centimetre to the west of the bottom of the white mountai.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	now m.
*SPE0:	go up the side of the mountain until you're maybe follow the side for up until about half an inch below the summi.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and then change to going due north for about three inche.
*SPE1:	up past the lemon grov.
*SPE0:	ah there's no lemon grove in this on.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	is there a pyrami.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	this'll be you just about a third of the way up the pyrami.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and then straight across until about a centimetre to the west of the pyrami.
*SPE1:	will we walk to the top of i.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	straight across unti.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	on the same leve.
*SPE1:	okey-doke.
*SPE0:	and then mm go up over the top of the pyramid and in a a cone sort of a a triangle shape and down the other side until you're at the base of the pyrami.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	do you have a cobbled stree.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	below the pyramid there's a cobbled street an.
*SPE1:	directly below i.
*SPE0:	ehm it's below the western side of the pyrami.
*SPE1:	right so it'll b.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	from where you are just now draw a curved line 'til you're below the "d" of pyrami.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then straight across until you're just below the point of the pyramid at the western ti.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go at an angle slightly more slightly to the west of sout.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	to avoid the cobbled street ther.
*SPE0:	and do you have a remote villag.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and just to where the the thick lines at the remote village drawing ar.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	just about a centimetre to the west of the l-- thick line and stop ther.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	curve round draw a curve until you're below the "r" of remot.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE0:	straight across until you're below the "e.
*SPE1:	the "e" in remot.
*SPE0:	the "e" in village sorr.
*SPE1:	"e" in villag.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE0:	go straight across another inch and that's the finis.
*SPE1:	okey-dokey there we g.
*SPE1:	have i missed anythin.
