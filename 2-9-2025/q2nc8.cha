*SPE0:	do you have tha.
*SPE1:	i've got the start yea.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	you're going to move around the left of the telephone kiosk the same distance as you are above i.
*SPE0:	you're about what half an inch above i.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	downward.
*SPE0:	downwards sort of skippin.
*SPE1:	to the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	down until you're about an inch from the bottom of the page you should be skipping the edge of the page by about half an inc.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	now take it do you have a stone circle at the botto.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	no you don'.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	now are you like if you come in a wee bit so that you're about an inch away from both edge.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	if you get to that poin.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	now move along about an inc.
*SPE1:	to the righ.
*SPE0:	to the righ.
*SPE0:	directly horizontally acros.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	now curve up and out a wee bit and then straight u.
*SPE1:	up and up and left or righ.
*SPE0:	so that you'r.
*SPE0:	see where your farmer's gate i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	we're going to come up on the left-hand side of that you'll just skim it by about a centimetr.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	up and to the righ.
*SPE0:	up to the left-hand side of it yeah until you're at the top left-hand corner of the drawin.
*SPE1:	of the broken gat.
*SPE0:	of the broken gate that's correc.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	you're going to move righ.

*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	see the third seagull alon.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	now go upwards until you're level with the point you're at at the f-- the broken gat.
*SPE1:	sorry have i to go round the top of i.
*SPE0:	no n.
*SPE0:	don't don't draw anything ye.
*SPE0:	just like say with your finger an imaginary poin.
*SPE1:	above the third seagul.
*SPE0:	above the seagull so that both like your pe.
*SPE0:	and your finger are leve.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	now if you raise your right this imaginary point up about three quarters of an inch sa.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	see the point you're at ther.
*SPE0:	draw a diagonal line linking these two point.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	do you have a ruined monaster.
*SPE1:	eh not near where i am just no.
*SPE1:	it's in the middle of the pag.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	right up at the middle of the pag.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	now if you say put make a point that that's just off the top right-hand turret or whatever it is you know just the top right-hand edge of tha.
*SPE1:	okay yea.
*SPE0:	it's about a centimetre off i.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	if you draw a kind of diagonal line curving yoursel.
*SPE1:	round the monastery down to where i wa.
*SPE0:	eh just from that edge to where you wer.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	do you have the overnight accommodatio.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	but you can go through tha.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	okay oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	now do you have the west lake down to your lef.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	right if you draw like a curved arch from the point you're at eh over the top of the the ruin.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	back down to like say a point that's level only on the other sid.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	what you're going to do is you're going to continue your downward line for about another inch moving down towards let me see in a compass direction it would be southwes.
*SPE0:	right just continue down the wa.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	moving both outwards and downward.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	now skim a line that's pointing diagonally up if you take a point about an inch and a half from the edge of the pag.
*SPE1:	level with where i a.
*SPE0:	level from where you ar.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	then move that point up half an inch so you've got a kind of diagonal line agai.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	okay this is the left-hand edge of the page yea.
*SPE1:	yeah oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	if you connect these two point.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	do you have a stile above yo.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	are you downwards and slightly to the left of the stil.
*SPE1:	i'm down and about an inch to the lef.
*SPE0:	an inch to the oka.
*SPE0:	you could come in a wee bit so that when you go up you uh you go up to the top left-hand corner of the stile but you're only say about a centimetre from the edge so that's your lin.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	your point should be downwards you probably got the distance correct down the way but that'll be your rout.
*SPE1:	up to the top of the stil.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	top left-hand corne.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	now if you like sort of draw a line along the top of that as if we're skirting round the ex-- the edge of i.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	again now we're going to move straight up about an inch and a hal.
*SPE1:	from the right-hand corner of the stil.
*SPE0:	i'v.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	do you have an obstacle ther.
*SPE1:	i've got a popular tourist spot slightly to the right and up from the stil.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	now we go u.
*SPE0:	right so you're at a point that's probably about two to three inches away from both the top edge and the left-hand side edge is that correc.
*SPE1:	no not at the momen.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	right can you see that point well if you imagine a poin.
*SPE1:	up in the top left-hand corne.
*SPE0:	right the top left-hand corne.
*SPE0:	if you come down about three inche.
*SPE1:	aye right oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	i've got i've go.
*SPE0:	and you come in about three inches okay there's a poin.
*SPE1:	i've got a great viewpoint ther.
*SPE0:	oh wait a minut.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	no n.
*SPE0:	i've got a great viewpoint away up in the top left-hand corne.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	that's what i thought you were talking abou.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	if you diagonally if you came in the same distance agai.
*SPE0:	do you get it sh-.
*SPE0:	oh wait a minute what would that be hold o.
*SPE0:	one two three say four inches ac-- in fact chri.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	four inches away from the top edge four inches away from the the edge on the left-hand sid.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	now on my map that should be that's like up from the stil.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	now if you're at that point do you have a a dead tree it's an elm tree down to you.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE1:	right over the other side of the pag.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	now see there the letter "d.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	that one oh i've got dead tree you've got elm tre.
*SPE1:	i've got dutch el.
*SPE0:	is i.
*SPE0:	dutch el.
*SPE0:	is it written underneath the tre.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	see the first letter of dutch sa.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	okay about a centimetre below tha.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	okay if you draw a line is that a can you ha-- have a diagonal line going from where you are right down t.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	do you go through anythin.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	see the popular viewpoint what happened to it did we go round it or wha.
*SPE1:	no we just stayed away from i.
*SPE0:	oh never went anywhere near i.
*SPE1:	no w-- well we went round the popular tourist spot we avoided the great viewpoin.
*SPE0:	yeah okay went round that that's fin.
*SPE0:	okay you're going to curve half a circle around that tre.
*SPE1:	up the wa.
*SPE0:	up the wa.
*SPE0:	so tha.
*SPE0:	see the third branch from the lef.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	until you're say above that that's your half circl.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	okay you've done a "u" tur.
*SPE0:	no.
*SPE0:	if you draw like a kin.
*SPE0:	let's se.
*SPE0:	see where you have the east lake at the to.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	right if you draw a line if you go from the "e" in lake down the wa.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	on to the edge of the lak.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then say about half a centimetre from the edge of the lake if you connect those two point.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	now skirt the edge of the lake to the left move left along the edge of the lak.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	for about three inche.
*SPE1:	to the corne.
*SPE0:	yeah to the corne.
*SPE0:	so you're just past go past that co-- don't go up or anything like that just go past the corner for about an inc.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and finish ther.
*SPE0:	yo.
*SPE0:	oka.
