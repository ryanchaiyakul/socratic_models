*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	it's about three or four centimetres down from tha.

*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	see how there's about a centimetr.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	you go from the start sort of do a curve to get back onto the line and go down due south for bddllpp e.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	just missing the camera sho.
*SPE0:	just missing the camera shop yea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	is there allotment.
*SPE0:	down to where's the allotment.
*SPE0:	yes there i.
*SPE0:	oh you go down about double the length of tha.
*SPE0:	see between the start and the allotment.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	do the same distance again between that in fact a wee bit more i'd say about twelve thirteen centimetres down to the botto.
*SPE1:	dow.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	so you should be about a centimetre away from the left-hand side of the page and about two s-- two or three centimetres above the botto.
*SPE1:	the bottom of the pag.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	oh wait a minute wh-- fr-- how many centimetres from the w-.
*SPE0:	about one centimetre from the left-hand side of the pag.
*SPE1:	oh righ.
*SPE1:	well so going back a bi.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	right okay then i know right i know what i'm doing no.
*SPE0:	uh-huh uh-huh righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	you've just g-- really got a straight line down from the start missing the camera sho.
*SPE1:	right aye right i've got i.
*SPE0:	okay eh now i've got a parked van here so i'm just trying to go round it you're sort of doing a "u" shape back round past where my parked van is so just go east for about four five centimetre.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	so you're going aiming towards the yacht club but you're going nowhere near as far as tha.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.

*SPE1:	just before it i'm not actually touched the allotments ye.
*SPE0:	all right that's good that's goo.
*SPE0:	because what you're doing is you're going up the side of the allotment.
*SPE1:	right okay i'm jus.
*SPE0:	so you're doing you're continuing that "u" shape from where you were at the start you're sort of going back up heading north towards the side of the allotment.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	see the wee black house at the left-hand side of the allotment.
*SPE1:	am i just going straight u.
*SPE0:	yes straight up f-- from there righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	is that all righ.
*SPE1:	right okay righ.
*SPE0:	right so you're at the s-- you're at th.
*SPE1:	i'm at the wee black house now at the left of the allotment.
*SPE0:	at the wee black house that's brilliant that's brillian.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	so have you got a sort of "u"-shaped a sort of half "u" shap.
*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	right that's okay that's fin.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	right this is where it gets difficul.
*SPE0:	e.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	'cause you're aiming into the middle of nowhere there's abou.
*SPE0:	i've got a yacht club righ.
*SPE0:	at the bottom right-hand sid.
*SPE1:	eh.
*SPE1:	uh-huh righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see if you forget about the line for a minute if you pick a point about sss.
*SPE0:	see the edge of the left-hand yacht righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	the bottom edge of it the corne.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	if you aim above that for about six centimetres righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	a point up ther.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	if you can draw a diagonal line from the wee black house in the allotments up to the top up to the where that point is about six centimetre.
*SPE1:	a-- have you got a flight museu.
*SPE0:	i've not n.
*SPE0:	have you got a flight museum in the middle somewher.

*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	if i go up from the bottom left-hand corner of this yacht if i go up about six centimetre.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm just like about one centimetre from this to the left of this eh to the right of this flight museu.
*SPE0:	one centimetre to the right o-.
*SPE1:	but i suppose ehm i suppose if i draw a line from that wee house it might just miss the flight museu.
*SPE0:	i think that's o-- pf.
*SPE0:	right well what you're doing is you're drawing a line it's not exactly eh east right it's sort of between two and three o'clock it's very very gradual incline up for about fourteen centimetres twelv.
*SPE1:	right i n-- i know what i know what what you're doin.
*SPE0:	see what i'.

*SPE0:	eh what you're doing now is you're going along to the right just above the top of the alpine garden whatever those if that's weeds or something eh you're going along for two to three centimetre.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	right so i'm going to the right of the alpine garden a-- the top of i.
*SPE0:	uh-huh to the right uh-hu.
*SPE0:	the top just straight across righ.

*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE0:	eh now go right for about two centimetre.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	just a straight line right for two centimetre.
*SPE1:	so have you got this parked va.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	you should be under the let-- under the letter "v" i think round about "v.
*SPE1:	what wh-- what l-- lette.

*SPE0:	it's a big massive diagonal line it's about fifteen centimetres long or something like tha.
*SPE1:	right down to the b-.
*SPE0:	right down to the letter "t" right down to the botto.
*SPE1:	t-- to the top of i.
*SPE1:	or the bottom of it right oka.
*SPE0:	to the bottom of it sorr.
*SPE0:	just underneath the letter "t.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	right that's m.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then all yo.
*SPE1:	this looks quite nic.
*SPE0:	fra-- frame it an.
*SPE1:	sorr.
*SPE1:	i'm quite please.
*SPE0:	oh you should have seen neil's we had to start all over again you kno.
*SPE1:	had to do that with dawn anywa.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	e.
*SPE1:	we're at the bottom of the "t.
*SPE0:	we're underneath the letter "t" at the momen.
*SPE0:	go along just sort of underline telephone box just a t-- a fraction underneath telephone underline it right to the letter "x.
*SPE1:	righ.

*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	and you just go to the edge of the letter "x.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	you're on the right-hand side of i.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	then all you're doing is going up for about another three centimetres to just just above the top of the telephone bo.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	about half a centimetre above the top of the telephone bo.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	now this is where you've not got a thatched mud hu.

*SPE1:	the bottom right-hand corne.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	well you're wanting see the "k" of lak.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	you're wanting to end up just about half a centimetre away from the bottom of the lake itself but underneath the letter "k.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	but don't draw a straight diagonal lin.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	because you want to from where you are just now you're above the telephone box that righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	uh-huh i'm above the telephone bo.
*SPE0:	you're wanting to sort of go it's a sort of curve aiming to the left and then going straight nort.
*SPE0:	do you know what i mean it's like th-- the left-hand side of a "u" or something like that righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	you're at the bottom o.
*SPE1:	have y-- have you got this le-.
*SPE1:	oh you've not got this level crossing on have yo.

*SPE0:	eh so you'r.
*SPE0:	mu-- thatched mud hut it's directly above the telephone box at the momen.
*SPE0:	so that's what you're trying to avoid if you can imagine a thatched mud hut sort of halfway between the telephone box and the bottom right-hand corner of the east lak.
*SPE0:	right you're sort of going lef.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i'm wanting to go lef.
*SPE0:	and then north up to just below the "k" but on the don't go into the lake just stay outside i.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	i kind of right i see that's that there righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	do you sort of see where i'm goin.
*SPE1:	i know you're goin.
*SPE0:	so you should have a sort of a "u" shape ther.
*SPE1:	but i've got this stupid level crossin.
*SPE0:	oh forget it oh you can go-- you can walk across tha.
*SPE1:	right i'll just go up this side of it righ.
*SPE1:	i think i've missed i.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then you're so you're just underneath the botto.
*SPE1:	i'm about ha-- i'm about ya-- under the "k.
*SPE0:	right that's righ.
*SPE1:	i'm not in the lake thoug.
*SPE0:	that's righ.
*SPE0:	just you know the bottom of the lake it's sort of going diagonall.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	follow that the bottom of the lake right up keep about half a centimetre away from it and follow it up to the lef.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	to the bottom corner of the lake the pointy bi.
*SPE0:	see i.
*SPE1:	oh right this i-- this is to the left this is towards the parked va.
*SPE0:	have you got a pointy bi.
*SPE0:	yes this is t-- aiming towards the parked va.
*SPE1:	right okay right oka.
*SPE0:	so you're right under the bottom corner at the momen.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and just continue that line for about another centimetre and that's the finish just in the exact sam.
*SPE1:	just below that wee bum.
*SPE0:	that's be-- just below the wee bump that's i.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	exactl.
*SPE0:	and that's i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	a.
*SPE0:	that's it very goo.
*SPE1:	no proble.
