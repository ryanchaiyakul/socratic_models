*SPE0:	right gre.
*SPE0:	you've got the start with the "x.
*SPE1:	top left-hand corne.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	you want to come down to about a centimetre left to the left of the haystack uh in a southwesterly directio.
*SPE1:	southeasterl.
*SPE0:	southeasterly direction yea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	now e.
*SPE0:	go down about the same distance to directly south below the starting point at about just below the level of the carpenter's house so from the haystack go down to directly below the starting cross to a level just below the carpenter's hous.
*SPE1:	where it says carpente.
*SPE0:	well across from that directly below the star.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	so it's going to be in a southwesterly directio.
*SPE1:	avoiding the blacksmit.
*SPE0:	what blacksmit.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	there's a blacksmith next to the carpenter on the left-hand side of i.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	i see righ.
*SPE0:	eh take the line towards well along horizontally to e.
*SPE0:	the carpenter's got a couple of stile.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	and dyke.
*SPE0:	just take it about oh i don't know about a couple of centimetres to the bottom you know a couple of cen-- eh about an inc.
*SPE1:	an inc.
*SPE0:	no not even an inch about half an inc.
*SPE0:	take it horizontally which takes you about oh about an inch and a half away from the carpenters just below where the carpenter i.
*SPE1:	at the stiles just at the stile.
*SPE0:	just below the stiles belo.
*SPE0:	take it down a centimetre and across a centimetre from the last stile to the left horizontall.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	right and tha.
*SPE0:	have you got tha.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	right e.
*SPE0:	you've got green bay at the to.
*SPE0:	see green ba.
*SPE0:	no no green ba.
*SPE1:	no green ba.
*SPE0:	well e.
*SPE0:	in a northwesterly direction northeasterly direction sorry and you want a line about oh one two hchchch i would take it maybe two and a half inches northwest avoiding the carpenter's house all the way up so you want a north w-- easterly direction about dwrlr thirty five to forty degrees just below forty-fiv.
*SPE1:	for how many inche.
*SPE0:	for about two and a half inche.
*SPE0:	right e.
*SPE0:	eh about two inches to the slightly below east next you want to go east about s-- just below east for about two inche.
*SPE1:	over towards the the seven beeche.
*SPE0:	over towards the seven beeche.
*SPE0:	and you want to finish up about an inch high and about oh three quarters of an inch to the left of the seven beeche.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	e.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you want to come past the seven beeche.
*SPE0:	have you got the chape.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	you've not got a chape.
*SPE0:	just below well you want to come down aloalo let me see south just off south the same about the same you know how you came below east you want the same to the east of south about the same sort of about five degrees off basicall.
*SPE1:	right mmhm.
*SPE0:	t.
*SPE1:	so slightly southeas.
*SPE0:	slightly southeas.
*SPE0:	about five degrees southeas.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and you want to come across you want to come down about two inches again just below where it says eh seven beeche.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	well that'll be about a centimetre below the beech tree.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	so finish up next to the "s" of seve.
*SPE0:	basically ye.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	right on my drawing i've got a chapel that's about an inch long on the on the map it starts directly below the "s" and e.
*SPE0:	we've got to go round this in sort of a circular direction you're going to be moving east and then back and finishing about under the second beech tree the right-hand beech tree so you want to what you want to do is you're going down about two inches again but you've got a eh a net move east of about an inch so from the "s" you've got about two inches down and one inch two inches south and about one inch east and you want to come round eh about about one inch one inch east and one inch south and do a curv.
*SPE1:	curve that on.
*SPE0:	right curve i.
*SPE0:	and then you want to go in a southwest of there like direction until you meet the eh the what i ini-- what i init-- ini-- i initially sai.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	this is complicate.
*SPE1:	how abou.
*SPE0:	but what your point your initial point mark a point two inches south one inch east of the where you stopped the last tim.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	okay have you done that ye.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	eh to get the curve i would go one inch down from where your your point is just now an.
*SPE1:	one inch sout.
*SPE0:	one inch sout.
*SPE0:	and one inch east and now you want to do a curve from your initial point to that point then down to the two inc.
*SPE1:	then then straight down to the two inch mar.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	it's southwest er about five ten degrees off south to the southwest to finish under the beech tree the the right-hand beech tre.
*SPE1:	going southwes.
*SPE0:	going southwes.
*SPE1:	to finish under the second beech tree i would have to go southeast if i only moved over one inch to the east in the first movement because you said two inche.
*SPE0:	t-.
*SPE0:	well make it one and a half inch sorry one and a half inch eas.
*SPE1:	what's one and a hal.
*SPE0:	you what you want to do is you want to clear the eh first movement round the chapel will have to clear the beech trees and then come down again to under the first ts on the right-hand beech tre.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'll try and describe it to you what i thin.
*SPE1:	i've come down from to the "s" i'm at the "s" just no.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	of seven i'll continue down but curving round to my righ.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	okay until i've done a quarter curve a quarter of a circl.
*SPE0:	that's right yea.
*SPE0:	and that should be just on the level of the the very end of the wee leaves on the beech tree.
*SPE1:	ah in mine that's far more than an inc.
*SPE0:	well i'll wait to do it until the end the.
*SPE1:	right that's okay right i know that n-.
*SPE1:	and now i can head bac.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	s-- in a s-- southeasterly direction t.
*SPE0:	see what southwesterly ay.
*SPE1:	southwesterly to the point below this trunk of the second beech tre.
*SPE0:	oh that's right yea.
*SPE1:	right i'll draw that the.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	do you have reclaimed field.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	so e.
*SPE0:	you'll be wanting to g.
*SPE1:	it's about an inch and a half to two inches below where i am just no.
*SPE0:	about an inch and a half to two inches below where you are the no.
*SPE0:	the reclaimed field.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	aye see e.
*SPE0:	well what you want to do here is you want to go round it in a sort of tube like f-- form like a test tube you want to do a test tube round i.
*SPE0:	so you want to go well you're two inches down e.
*SPE1:	will i go down continuing the same gradient i'm on will i go down 'til i'm just above the reclaimed field.
*SPE0:	well you've go.
*SPE0:	what have you got reclaimed fields and then sort of soiled ground to the right-hand side of i.
*SPE1:	eh there's nothing to the right-hand sid.
*SPE1:	on the left-hand side there's a whitewashed cottag.
*SPE0:	whitewashed cot-.
*SPE0:	on the right-hand sid.
*SPE1:	on the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	left-hand side whitewashe.
*SPE0:	eh wel.
*SPE0:	we're going we're going to go round the right-hand side of i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	so you want to com.
*SPE0:	do you have crane ba.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	well what my map does it does this test tube thing round the reclaimed fields then it heads south towards th.
*SPE0:	you've got a lower right-hand tip and then you've got two tips off crane bay on the right-hand side which are just about on the same leve.
*SPE0:	can you see that just above the "b" of crane ba.
*SPE0:	so i want to come round the c-- reclaimed fields and you're heading west and then you head south and you follow the line of crane ba.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE1:	so will i move down to nearer reclaimed field.
*SPE0:	move down to nearer reclaimed field.
*SPE0:	go round i.
*SPE1:	right right d-- un-.
*SPE1:	under what letter will i finish the test tube shap.
*SPE0:	eh just past the "r" just past the the drawing of the reclaimed field.
*SPE1:	that that would be me right over at the whitewashed cottage then next to tha.
*SPE0:	just to the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	well don't go that far then come about an inch before i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	and it's that'll be about under the the "c" of reclaime.
*SPE0:	okay that'll f-- do fine ye.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	have you got tha.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	well just below that south of that there's a point just above the "b" of crane ba.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	like a wee sort of a.
*SPE1:	a wee bay bit in i.
*SPE0:	a wee poin.
*SPE0:	there's a sm-- a smiley face and then there's .
*SPE1:	there's no smiley fac.
*SPE0:	see if you want to come due south to that point and then follow the coast a bi.
*SPE1:	follow the coast to wher.
*SPE0:	follow the coast round e.
*SPE0:	you've got it does a curve and then it meets a point then it goes just about south crane bay it's got a curve and then it goes due sout.
*SPE0:	can you see tha.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	i've got a meadow to the left of that due south pe.
*SPE0:	porashi.
*SPE1:	a vast meado.
*SPE0:	a vast meado.
*SPE1:	i've got a vast meadow up just below the blacksmiths and carpenter.
*SPE0:	well is that huge big and there's nothing at all in that spac.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	except a vast meado.
*SPE0:	about halfway up the pag.
*SPE1:	about halfway up the page it's empty on min.
*SPE0:	well you want to well anyway follow crane bay round the curv.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	goes going goin.
*SPE1:	following the contour more or les.
*SPE0:	going west following the contou.
*SPE0:	until you meet just where you stop going wes.
*SPE0:	and we head south we head southwest there coming out you see it goes you go just about due south then it finishes it's about an inch and a half lon.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and just where it finishes there come about you want to be about an inch to the west of that where you where you stop after going southwes.
*SPE1:	so it's south on the actual crane bay then it's about an inch and a half going sout.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	and then about an inch going wes.
*SPE0:	that's righ.
*SPE0:	just about a centimetre abov.
*SPE1:	the west ti.
*SPE0:	the west han.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	now have you got attractive cliffs ther.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and you want to follow across the top of them wes.
*SPE1:	across the to.
*SPE0:	wes.
*SPE0:	just below i've got a vast meadow ther.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	where will i stop that line abo-- across the to.
*SPE0:	eh about a centimetre after attract-- attractive cliff.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	you want to go down about ten degrees off south southwes.
*SPE1:	mm about a hundred and ninety degree.
*SPE0:	about eh ay.
*SPE0:	about a hundred and ninety-five i would sa.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	towards crashed spaceshi.
*SPE0:	i've not got crashed spaceship er spaceshi.
*SPE0:	and that's that'.
*SPE1:	do you have the chestnut tre.
*SPE0:	yeah i've got the chestnut tre.
*SPE0:	that's my f-- your finishing poin.
*SPE1:	eh wel.
*SPE1:	i've got a crashed spaceshi.
*SPE1:	the right the the straight distance between attractive cliffs and chestnut tree about half of that distance between them in a straight line and then two inches over to the wes.
*SPE0:	that's just about on the edge of the pag.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE1:	there's a crashed spaceshi.
*SPE1:	we're assuming that the top of the map is nort.
*SPE1:	i would imagine righ.
*SPE0:	ye.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so where will i go no.
*SPE0:	s-- so where are you at bottom of the attractive cliff.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	i'm at the to.
*SPE0:	the to.
*SPE0:	well you want one nine fiv.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	to wher.
*SPE0:	to the bottom of the attractive cliffs just about ah about a centimetre below the attractive cliff.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	eh you've got a space craft about her.
*SPE1:	about .
*SPE0:	how far from the edge of the pag.
*SPE1:	well the s-- i just now i'm an inch to the an inch east ah no a centimetre east of the crashed spaceship and at the very top of i.
*SPE0:	well e.
*SPE0:	so can you come below i.
*SPE0:	you're going to have to come below it ye.
*SPE0:	or can you go round the to.
*SPE1:	oh i can come straight down past the side of it i can come south just now if i want t.
*SPE0:	s-- can you come south and then come slightly west then south again or can you go s-- we-- can you go west just now then south and then east to the finis.
*SPE1:	i can't go i can't go west just now reall.
*SPE0:	you can't go wes.
*SPE0:	take it a bit more southwest until you're below i.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	i could go i could go west past the top of it if you wanted to right over to the edge of the pag.
*SPE0:	well do that yeah do tha.
*SPE0:	and you want to go south when you get about half a centimetre to the edge of the pag.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	until the bottom of the chestnut tre.
*SPE1:	in the very botto.
*SPE0:	the very bottom of the chestnut tre.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	ba-- but above the words chestnut tre.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	the bottom of the trunk of the chestnut tre.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	and then you want to go east along the line of the bottom of the chestnut tree to about oh half an inch away from the botto.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then you want to go up to the the mid portion of the chestnut tree to finish just below where the the f-- eh the leaf-line start.
*SPE1:	over at the tree itsel.
*SPE0:	well you're about half an inch away from i.
*SPE1:	s.
*SPE1:	i'm here just now above the "c" of chestnu.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	you want to go up like abou.
*SPE1:	due nort.
*SPE0:	due north about half just where the wee bump in the tree i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and that's your finish with a big cros.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	there's no finish point marked on thi.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	there's your big cros.
*SPE1:	righ.
