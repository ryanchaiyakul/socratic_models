*SPE1:	s.
*SPE1:	i'm going between the picket fence and the mil.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	if the you start right you go down straight down under the picket fenc.
*SPE1:	under the picket fence righ.
*SPE0:	go right round the picket fenc.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	got to do a curve come straight u.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'll have you know like i'll have to so i'm going between the picket fence and the mill righ.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	are you not going right under the picket fenc.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE1:	but you see the mill kind of overlaps my picket fenc.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	you'll have to go right round it on the left-hand sid.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i'm going rou-- round the left-hand side of the mil.

*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see above that bi-- an inch and a half right about two inches righ.
*SPE0:	mark that mark a spot right above th-- about two inches above the fenced meadow on the very left of that picture go up about two inches right and mark a spo.
*SPE1:	on the left of the fenced meado.
*SPE0:	uh-huh on left of that picture right of the fenced meado.
*SPE0:	come about two inche.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	oh the from the bottom of the pictur.
*SPE0:	uh-huh uh-hu.
*SPE1:	come up about two inche.
*SPE0:	where the fence is right on the left-hand s-.
*SPE1:	right i'.
*SPE1:	so i'm below a fores.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and see where the o-- bi-- that but see where the old mill i.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	see you come up draw a line between that and that where that fenced meadow where you've just made a mark right draw a straight lin.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i should be just a ve-- just below the forest as wel.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	i don't have a forest so eh.
*SPE1:	oh right i se.
*SPE0:	i presume it must b.
*SPE0:	so you must go round tha.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see where you are the.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	draw a straight line going u.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and curve round the abandoned cottage right above i.
*SPE1:	i ha-.
*SPE1:	i have to curve round the fores.
*SPE0:	right s.
*SPE0:	and curve right up round above th.
*SPE1:	so i'm going round the right-hand side of the forest which you haven't go.
*SPE0:	to to you.
*SPE0:	mmhmm you will be yea.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	go round the right sid.
*SPE0:	and then right round t-- to to your left curve round to your left and you're going up above the abandoned cottag.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i'm going to the left-hand side of the abandoned cottag.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	go righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see where the forest is righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	you're go-- you're curving right up and keep curving right round the side of the right-hand side sorry of the abandoned cottage so you're going round in a circl.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm curving round i.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	th-- the right-hand side go down righ.
*SPE0:	see where they've they've got the chimney righ.
*SPE1:	chimney n.
*SPE0:	right see where that's s-- n.
*SPE1:	i don't have a chimne.
*SPE0:	see where the chimney is on the abandoned cottag.
*SPE1:	oh ye.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	right have you sto-- oka.
*SPE0:	stop about ther.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	have you got a fenced meadow on your le-- and about halfway up as wel.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	you don't have a fenced meadow e.
*SPE1:	where's tha.
*SPE0:	it's int-- half it's about halfway up the page and it's on the right the left-hand side of the pag.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	halfway u.
*SPE1:	i'm kind of in line with the a-- abandoned cottag.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	about a wee bit eh an angle down towards your left a wee bit i-- it's e.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	go u.
*SPE0:	see where the chimney is righ.
*SPE0:	sort of make about a forty-five degree angle towards for about about an inc.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	an inc.
*SPE0:	did it go down d-.
*SPE0:	make an ang-- an angle to the bottom of that picture right going to your lef.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	so you're about an inch away from the abandoned cottage if you what i mean you're curving right roun.
*SPE1:	i've curved round the abandoned cottag.
*SPE0:	right s.
*SPE0:	sort of right right where you've stopped righ.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	at that curve it should be about an inch away from the abandoned cottage righ.
*SPE1:	i'm not that far awa.
*SPE1:	i never kne.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	well can you make it make that curv.
*SPE1:	but e-- i oh sorry i've still avoi-- i've still avoided the abandoned cott-.
*SPE0:	and then where you've stopped the curve sort of make a wide circl.
*SPE0:	eh have you got something between the a-- beside the abandoned cottag.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	wel.
*SPE1:	i've got i've just got a monument to the righ.
*SPE0:	to the righ.
*SPE0:	mm ah so have .
*SPE0:	i know where you ar.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	do you know west lake is at the to.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	have you got a trig poin.
*SPE0:	no you don't do yo.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	have you got anything between west lake and abandoned cottag.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	nothing at al.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	have yo.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	wha.
*SPE0:	i've got a me-- a fenced meadow but in the dire-.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so i have to avoid tha.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	s.
*SPE1:	am i going round the west lak.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	say the fenc-- say the fenced meadow's about halfway u.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see where the abandoned cottage i.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	just down a wee bit right from that on the lef.
*SPE0:	so you make sure you avoid that right round the very left-hand side the page sort of mark a bit so you avoid tha.
*SPE1:	it's it's down a bit from the abandoned cottag.
*SPE0:	abandoned cottage about .
*SPE1:	on the lef.
*SPE0:	a centimetre uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i-- it's f-- the very left of the pag.
*SPE0:	uh-huh the very left uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see right where are you now at the bottom of the abandoned cottag.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	about an inch awa.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	the top of the abandoned cottag.
*SPE0:	did you make a curv.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	i've just come i've curved round the top of the abandoned cottag.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	that's all i've don.
*SPE0:	i-- mark about an inch away from the abandoned cottage right and to your left mark about an inch away from tha.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	a wee dot ther.
*SPE1:	eh n.
*SPE0:	no can you mark a dot ther.
*SPE1:	wher.
*SPE0:	about an inch away from the abandoned cottage on the left-hand side make it make it about an inch righ.
*SPE1:	i'm not righ.
*SPE0:	and see where the roo-- you've the top of the roof i.
*SPE0:	your your curve make a make a cu-- a line from there to ther.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	right i've done tha.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see where the west lake i.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	brrrr see where ehm the very bottom curve of it i.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	can you make it lik.
*SPE0:	see where you are now you're about an inch away from the abandoned cottage righ.
*SPE0:	can you make a sort of a wide circle sort of a half circle towards the ehm bottom of that point that curve of west lak.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	right see where the "e" is in west lak.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	in lak.
*SPE0:	eh go r-- it's right underneath ther.
*SPE0:	you know i'm talking about that poin.
*SPE0:	where it starts to curve like it's to there eh you need a kind of wide ci-- a h-- half circl.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE1:	a w-.
*SPE0:	eh but you're about an inch and a half away from the edge of the pag.
*SPE1:	what am i avoidin.
*SPE1:	see this eh what is it the thing you told me to mar.
*SPE0:	it's a fenced meado.
*SPE0:	you're going above tha.
*SPE1:	i'm going above that righ.
*SPE0:	you're going above tha.
*SPE0:	and you're about two inches away from the pag.
*SPE1:	so i'm doing a cir-.
*SPE0:	about a minut.
*SPE1:	so see on-- se.
*SPE1:	once i've done a circle up to where th.
*SPE0:	the west lake i.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	mmhmm follow the curve of the west lak.
*SPE1:	where do i go after tha.
*SPE1:	because i just i don't understan.
*SPE1:	what wa.
*SPE0:	right to oh aye to the ehm righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	so i'm what am i avoi-- you know how i'm curving round what am i avoidin.
*SPE0:	nothin.
*SPE0:	there's nothing there eithe.
*SPE1:	so why am i curvin.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	that's what it is that's where the route i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	right i've done tha.
*SPE0:	eh.
*SPE0:	so you've curv-- and like you follow the curve of west lak.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see where that see where i told you to go to stop a.
*SPE1:	you kno.
*SPE1:	so i'm like i'm really kind of doubling back on myself a bi.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	you've got you're following to the to the right-hand side you're going right round the right-hand side see right see when you come to the right see right imagine you're at th-- the that point okay underneath the "e.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i've don.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	at west lake right we're at that corner go round right round the circl.
*SPE1:	to the righ.
*SPE0:	the.
*SPE0:	uh-huh to the righ.
*SPE0:	then up keep going u.
*SPE1:	how fa.
*SPE1:	am i just sort of circling round the west lak.
*SPE0:	'til you sto.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	'til you sto.
*SPE0:	where it starts you know where it starts eh sort of going sharply to the left in a straight lin.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	stop ther.
*SPE1:	have you got farm land above there as wel.
*SPE0:	at that poin.
*SPE0:	uh-huh mmhmm so y-.
*SPE1:	about an inch below the farm land righ.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	right i've done tha.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see beside ehm see where you've stopped then right do you know where that sharp bit is i'm talking abou.
*SPE1:	just it curves round and then it goes up vertically and then you've i-.
*SPE0:	follow that bit up vertically right 'til it stops going vertically that's what i mean righ.
*SPE1:	uh-huh i've done that righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see where you've stoppe.
*SPE0:	and how you can see a kind of a straight line it's almost a straight lin.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	eh.
*SPE0:	to your left in the west lake you know it goes folli-- it's sort of goes up vertically and it goes straight to your left well it goes up a bi.
*SPE1:	it goes up vertically then it goes to the lef.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	just where it stops going vertically righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	can you see the monumen.
*SPE1:	i don't have a monumen.
*SPE1:	oh no i have a mo-.
*SPE0:	you do have a monument it's on the it's on the right-hand side it's to the right-hand side of the page about halfway u.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	away dow.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	see where you've stoppe.
*SPE0:	draw a straight line in that in that in that angl.
*SPE0:	see where that that vertical see that eh.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	that line on the west lake goes sh-- sharply u.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	dra-- draw eh that's it's that angle i'm talking about draw a straight line to the monument from ther.
*SPE1:	right down to the monument e.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	on that angl.
*SPE1:	and e.
*SPE1:	have you got a golf cours.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	i take it you're going round the golf cours.
*SPE0:	just draw a straight lin.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	the golf course is like nearer the east lake below the east lake s.
*SPE0:	ah so it i.
*SPE1:	so i would be going to the left-hand side of the golf cours.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	so where see the monument i.
*SPE0:	you're going underneath the monument and u.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	you're curving round the monumen.
*SPE1:	i'm com-- i'm doing like a i'm drawing a straight line down to the monument and curving r-.
*SPE0:	and go round underneath i.
*SPE1:	round the bottom of i.
*SPE0:	and curve round the bottom of it uh-hu.
*SPE1:	i mean and like you've not got any obstacles here have you belo.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	between the west lake and the monumen.
*SPE0:	the west lake and the monumen.
*SPE0:	i've got a p-- trig poin.
*SPE1:	where's that so i have i have to avoid i.
*SPE0:	that's that's it's abou-- it's okay if you've gone right up towards that if you've gone right u.
*SPE1:	but where is it anywa.
*SPE0:	where the vertical bit i.
*SPE1:	where is i.
*SPE0:	see where the west lake is with the writing west lak.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	it's just about two inches away from that beside beside west lak.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so if i draw dow.
*SPE0:	you should have curved over it if you had followed that curve west lak.
*SPE1:	i will have right uh-hu.
*SPE0:	you will righ.
*SPE0:	and then you go straight it's a total straight lin.
*SPE1:	a straight lin.
*SPE0:	going sloping downwards towards the monumen.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i've and then curve round the monumen.
*SPE0:	round the monumen.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	just right round tha.
*SPE1:	i've done tha.
*SPE0:	eh sort of righ.
*SPE0:	are you at the of top the monument see the guy's hea.
*SPE1:	yes that's where i a.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	stop about there okay curved above i.
*SPE0:	ehm you know the east lake i.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	just go vertically up ther.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	how fa.
*SPE0:	fac.
*SPE0:	i'll tell you what would be even bette.
*SPE0:	see the the guy's head on the monument the guy's hand sorr.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	where it's pointing righ.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	s.
*SPE0:	go straight draw the line to you know where your fa-.
*SPE0:	see that curve that you're drawing round the monumen.
*SPE0:	stop above his han.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	ah i went a bit further 'cause i thought you sai.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and just c-- and go from there go straight up towards the east lake so you should be directly under the the "e" in lak.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	my monument's more to the right of the page than that the east lake's fa-.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	see the "e" in the word lak.
*SPE1:	oh the word the "e" in the word la-.
*SPE0:	the word "e.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	in the lake righ.
*SPE0:	see directly u-- underneath that on the on the coast line of that if you know what i mean the edge of i.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	make a dot there righ.
*SPE1:	direc-.
*SPE1:	directl.
*SPE1:	underneath the "e.
*SPE0:	underneath the "e.
*SPE0:	underneath the "e.
*SPE0:	make a dot right beside the lak.
*SPE0:	and from the monument the guy's hand on the monument draw a line from tha.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	to the east lake and then just follow the curve of the east lak.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	so you follow the curve of the east lake to the lef.
*SPE0:	sorry i've thought it was to the lef.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	so e.
*SPE0:	you know the bottom left of the east lak.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	about in a centimetre away from that keep drawing a line and then finish i.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	the botto-- wha-.
*SPE1:	say that agai.
*SPE0:	see the "e" in the eas.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	the letter the word eas.
*SPE0:	underneath that draw a line about an inch away from that okay keep following the coast lin.
*SPE0:	but don't don't go up don't go up verticall.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	don't go u.
*SPE0:	you kn-- h-- just go straight along that except carry the line o.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	how fa.
*SPE0:	for about another centimetr.
*SPE0:	and just draw a cros.
*SPE1:	a centimetre from the "e.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	is that al.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	y-- but see where the east lake is see that that kind of line you followe.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	s-- of the lak.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	d-- you haven't gone up have yo.
*SPE0:	'cause the line goes straight up you know how it goes vertically u.
*SPE1:	what with th.
*SPE1:	no i haven't done tha.
*SPE0:	wel.
*SPE0:	that's oka.
*SPE0:	that'll be it finishe.
