*SPE0:	yeah wel.
*SPE0:	don't go much you know don't go any higher than than the the height of the old pine or or the forest that must be where the bay is i don't have a bay there but th-- the route you know must miss the bay er so you know just go along 'til you get to the pine forest more or less and then go go down on the left-hand side of the pine fores.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	once you're at the bottom of the pine forest just where it says pin.

*SPE1:	say that agai.
*SPE0:	oh two or three inches down from the pine fores.

*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	don't worry about the wheatfields it's just to tell you where to stop the lin.
*SPE1:	right oka.
*SPE0:	never mind about it being an arc or a curve or anythin.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	just just go down the left-hand side of the pine fores.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	and once you get to the where it says pine draw a line from there to eh above the bakery but not the chimney a bit to the left of that in fact the left-hand side it must be a wee shed or whatever it i.

*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	eh take your line down to crane ba.
*SPE0:	oh i've got two wheatfields that's not important is it right anyway w-.
*SPE0:	so you get to the canal right you don't have one but g-- just go down about two inches until you get to crane bay and follow follow the curv.
