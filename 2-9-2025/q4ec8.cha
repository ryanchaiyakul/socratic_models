*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	ehm the diamond mine the d-- the diamond mine is like just eh to the the the right of you ther.
*SPE1:	right i've got the diamond min.
*SPE1:	i've got the start and the diamond min.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	now just go down beside the left-hand side of the diamond mine and eh just to below the words the first "d" ther.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	then draw a line ehm a kind of go from there eh to just below the "s" of springbok.
*SPE1:	don't have springbok.
*SPE0:	you don't have spri-- that's righ.
*SPE0:	ehm okay righ.
*SPE0:	in that case just draw a horizontal line to just below the eh to the the left of the "h" of highest viewpoin.
*SPE1:	horizonta.
*SPE0:	yes horizontal righ.
*SPE1:	hold on righ.
*SPE0:	now we're going to go round eh highest viewpoin.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	so e.
*SPE1:	a curve o.
*SPE0:	it well we can do it in a well just go eh vertically up to the "h.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	then make a curve round to the eh like a semicircl.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	eh is there anything below ther.
*SPE1:	there's the overgrown gull.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and eh what about safari truc.
*SPE1:	yes i've got tha.
*SPE0:	now where's the overgrown gull.
*SPE1:	it's between highest viewpoint and the safari truc.
*SPE0:	eh what the midway between the.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	and eh to the left or right of highest viewpoin.
*SPE1:	it's beneath i.
*SPE1:	it's to the right-hand sid.
*SPE0:	it's directly beneath i.
*SPE0:	to the right-hand side of safari truc.
*SPE1:	slightly to the right-hand sid.
*SPE0:	right of this one right oka.
*SPE1:	right to the middle of highest viewpoint anywa.
*SPE0:	okay righ.
*SPE0:	so go on the outsides eh towards the paper edge ehm down to safari truck in a a slight curv.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and then eh draw a diagonal line ehm from there across the top of safari truck down to field statio.
*SPE1:	that's on my map it's slightly above field station slightly above safari truc.
*SPE0:	what is above that f-.
*SPE1:	above that's field station's on a level slightly above safari truc.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	well mine's eh on the same leve.
*SPE0:	ehm it what what is there anything else that's in eh that's causing it to be up like tha.
*SPE1:	well there's a banana tree direc-- directly below diamond min.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	it's slightly below safari truck slightly below the level of safari truc.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE0:	well eh wh-- you're just next to the eh that what was the object you've just drawn pas.
*SPE1:	i've just drawn past the overgrown gull.
*SPE1:	i'm now at the top right-hand corner of safari truc.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	ehm well draw eh a kind of diagonal line and then turn i.
*SPE1:	up or dow.
*SPE0:	eh from right to left eh downward.
*SPE0:	eh underneath field statio.
*SPE1:	right that's way over the la-- the far left-hand side of the page on my ma.
*SPE0:	where is field statio.
*SPE1:	field station's way over the far lef.
*SPE0:	it's the far l-- u.
*SPE0:	well there's two field stations on my ma.
*SPE1:	there's not one on min.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	so you've only got one ther.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	and none there in the centre righ.
*SPE0:	ehm in that case you want to draw the diagonal line and the.
*SPE0:	where is banana tre.
*SPE1:	banana tree is directly below diamond mine and it's slightly above the centre of the pag.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	so eh well draw this d-- diagonal line down and then change it to a curve at the top level of banana tree and curve it round banana tree ehm with the apex of the curve pointing to the top right-hand corner sorry left-hand corne.
*SPE1:	right what was that again sorr.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	this pen's running out i thin.
*SPE0:	if you hold it eh vertically it'll come dow.
*SPE1:	it's gon.
*SPE1:	ah righ.
*SPE0:	is it okay no.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	right ehm right i'll just do the the bit at the safari truck righ.
*SPE0:	draw a diagonal line from where you wer.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	eh to the same just below the s-- the level of s-- the word safari truck and ab-- abou-- between banana tree and safari truc.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	which is slightly above eh banana tre.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	then draw a curve over banana tree ehm and curving round on i.
*SPE1:	down the left-hand sid.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	and ehm now do you have gold mine between eh banana tree and rock fall at the bottom ther.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	in that case eh well gold mine on my map is halfway between rock fall and banana tre.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	directly belo.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	it's directly below banana tree and directly above rock fall a-.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	and it's eh in the at the mid point of the two of that lin.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	so ehm i want you to come down to two thirds of the way between eh rock fall and banana tree hav.
*SPE1:	is that two thirds beneath banana tree or two thirds u.
*SPE0:	two t-- eh that's two third beneath banana tre.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	right ehm now there i want you to draw ehm a horizontal line to the left sorry to the right sorry eh to the right just eh so that you're on the other side of banana tree if you understan.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	then the rope bridge can you see that on your ma.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE1:	that's slightly above it's between where i am and banana tree roughly about halfway betwee.
*SPE0:	between where you are and wher.
*SPE1:	banana tre.
*SPE0:	right wel.
*SPE1:	it's on a line roughly between that it's over to the right-hand side of the pag.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	ehm are crocodiles the other side of the thin.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	yea.
*SPE0:	ehm and eh the crocodile's to the right of the rope bridg.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE1:	to the right and belo.
*SPE0:	right and below righ.
*SPE0:	ehm what i want you to do i.
*SPE0:	is there anything between the go-- eh between the where you are now and the rope bridg.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	i want you to draw a line up to the rope bridg.
*SPE1:	straight lin.
*SPE0:	yes a straight line up to rope bridge so that you can cross the rope bridge the actual bridge drawing of the bridge righ.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	now do you have giraffes at the bottom eh right-hand corne.
*SPE1:	ye.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	i want you to eh draw round the crocodile eh on the outside of the page down to giraffe.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	right i want you to go underneath the giraffe.
*SPE0:	and there's any other obstacles ther.
*SPE1:	there's a disused warehouse at the bottom roughly about two a third of the way in from the righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	is it eh bel-- is it above great lake and below g-- giraffe.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	it's to the right of great lake on a level with i.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	well in that case i want you to ehm eh curve slightly up to eh just go underneath the giraffes and eh to on a level with the the word giraffes and stop ther.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	right now i want you to eh go round the warehouse eh and under the great lak.
*SPE0:	by round i mean over like over the eh the warehous.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	right and then under the great lak.
*SPE0:	is there any other obstacles ther.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	and then come up between e.
*SPE0:	now it's the great lake and eh rock fall halfway between them but over to the left-hand side of the page is the finish poin.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	righ.
