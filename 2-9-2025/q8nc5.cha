*SPE1:	yea.
*SPE0:	right okay ehm righ.
*SPE0:	you're going to start coming down but a-- but as you come down you're c-- you curve to the righ.
*SPE1:	to the righ.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	bel-- just just below the burnt forest without touching the burnt fores.
*SPE1:	besi-.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	how fa.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you're what you're going to do is you're going to curve to the right and then back left okay so that when you come you're going to be about three to four inches below s-- directly below star.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	understand what i mea.
*SPE0:	so it's not going to it's n-- it's not going to be a straight line it's going to be a curv.
*SPE1:	have you not go.
*SPE1:	have you not got the carpenter's cottag.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	how f-- how far below the burnt forest do i g.
*SPE1:	do i go right along the beneath it before i curv.
*SPE0:	no you just see ho.
*SPE1:	i just go past i.
*SPE0:	uh-huh you jus.
*SPE1:	so it's only a slight curv.
*SPE0:	uh-huh it's just a slight curv.
*SPE1:	to the right and then back to the lef.
*SPE0:	uh-huh and then back to the lef.
*SPE1:	right uh-hu.
*SPE0:	okay so you're about eh three to four inches below start the.
*SPE0:	directly underneat.
*SPE1:	m.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE0:	so you're going to in a straight line go go to the righ.
*SPE0:	have you got the ravin.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	going to go straight along ehm say about along to the right leaving about an inch about an inch from the ravin.
*SPE1:	below i.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	then you're going to eh slope up to the right eh oh uh-huh to the left of the ravine you're going to slope up go above the top of the ravin.
*SPE1:	right s.
*SPE1:	i go along to the righ.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	until i'm about an inch below the ravine but to the left of i.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	and then i go up past the left-hand side of i.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	do you have the remote villag.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	well it doesn't doesn't matte.
*SPE1:	i'm now at the top left-hand side of the ravin.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	you can go about a centimetre above the rav-- the ravin.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	and the.
*SPE1:	still to the left of i.
*SPE0:	uh-huh uh-hu.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	and then you're going to go straight along to the right in a straight lin.
*SPE1:	have you got the pine grov.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	bef-- so don't go as far as the pine grov.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	so you should be about ehm level with the top of the pine grove that that far u.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	but you're about you know you're not in near the you're not at the pine grove ye.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	so you're about an inch and a half from the pine grov.
*SPE0:	you're going to your line is going to slope down to the right but you're going to keep to the left-hand side of the pine grov.
*SPE0:	i'm not making this very easy am i righ.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	see what i mea.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	so you go down until you're a-- ehm 'til you're at the bottom left-hand corner of the pine grov.
*SPE1:	bottom left-hand corne.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	but not ehm touching it o.
*SPE0:	no not touchin.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.

*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	i've got an avalanche above it thoug.
*SPE0:	oh righ.
*SPE0:	okay eh.
*SPE0:	directly above the concealed hideou.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	okay wel.
*SPE0:	i haven't got tha.
*SPE0:	but what you what you're going to do is you're going to right you've got we've got another curve on the line so this is probably why you're curving to avoid that avalanche so you curve first of all to the righ.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE0:	moving down all the tim.
*SPE1:	along wha-- what along the bottom of the pine grove or going past i.
*SPE0:	you're just you're just you're going down but also to the right you're g-- you're n-.
*SPE1:	towards the concealed hideou.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	where do i end up in relation to the concealed hideou.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	what happens is you go you curve to the right and then back into the left and then you curve r-- to the right again acro-- along the top of this concealed hideou.
*SPE1:	but i d-- i don't go along the bottom of the pine grov.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	so it's not much of a curv.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE1:	right e.
*SPE1:	and i end up to the left of the concealed hideou.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	you're going you're going to go to the right of the concealed hideout you're going to go along the top to the righ.
*SPE1:	along the top of i.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	'til you've sort of curved to the right then to the left and then back out to the right agai.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE1:	n.
*SPE1:	but i haven't hit anything s.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE0:	ehm righ.

*SPE0:	have you got the boat hous.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	what you're going to do is you're going to curve round the concealed hideout going round the right of it and then straight along until you get to the boat house the bottom left-hand corner of the boat hous.
*SPE1:	lef.
*SPE0:	n.
*SPE0:	bottom right-hand corner of the boat hous.

*SPE0:	right okay sorr.
*SPE0:	that's the wrong on.
*SPE0:	you don't wanna go anywhere near that on.

*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	so will i do a "u"-tur.
*SPE0:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	just just scrub that bit out then and go back up to the concealed hideou.
*SPE1:	oka.
*SPE0:	right s.
*SPE0:	le-- so v-- we'll say we're at the bottom right-hand corner of the concealed hideou.
*SPE1:	bottom righ.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE1:	uh-hu.
*SPE0:	right oka.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you're going to go in a straight line along the left of the pag.

*SPE0:	not not right along i mean it in a l-- i mean in a left directio.
*SPE1:	towards th.
*SPE1:	you mea.
*SPE1:	under the concealed hideou.
*SPE0:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	u-- under that a-- uh-huh al-.
*SPE1:	righ.
*SPE1:	i'm going along under the i'm now at the bottom left-hand corner of the the concealed hideout righ.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	don't go right do-.
*SPE0:	righ.
*SPE0:	you can go a bit further about another inc.
*SPE1:	righ.

*SPE0:	oka.
*SPE1:	mmhm.
*SPE0:	have you done that the.
