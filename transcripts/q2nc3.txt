who	$m	
g	right neil erm at the bottom 	
g	right-hand corner of your map do you have a missionary camp 	
f	yeah 	
g	about half an inch above it we've got an "x" marking start 	
g	have you got that 	
f	yes 	
f	yes 	
g	right 	
g	erm now i want you to take a route about one inch directly west 	
g	if the top of the page is north and the left-hand side of the page is west 	
g	i want you to go about one inch west 	
f	okay 	
g	now eh 	
g	we're heading about two inches southwest 	
g	eh which should leave you t-- at the bottom left-hand corner of the missionary camp about an inch diagonally away from it 	
f	right 	
f	got you 	
g	and then ab-- about an inch from the bottom of the page as well 	
f	sure okay 	
g	now on your map on the left-hand bottom corner do you have a bunch of rather nasty looking gorillas 	
f	no i don't 	
g	well i do and i think it's something we might want to avoid 	
f	right 	
g	right so erm 	
g	my route tells me to go on a slightly dipping downwards line west but don't draw it yet 'til i give you the exact instructions 	
f	okay 	
g	this line is dipping slightly down and to the left keeping about well you'd be better to go to within about half an inch of the bottom of the page so at the bottom left-hand corner you should be about an inch from both the left-hand side and the bottom of the page a-- a half an inch from the a-- 	
g	sorry i'll start that again 	
g	should be an inch from the left-hand side of the page and half an inch from the bottom side of the page at the bottom left-hand corner 	
g	okay 	
f	is this avoiding the banana tree 	
g	avoiding no 	
g	avoiding gorillas 	
g	have you got banana tree 	
f	i've got a banana tree 	
f	but it's probably in much the same place 	
g	yeah 	
f	right 	
f	i'll just go to where you say it avoids the banana tree anyway 	
g	right okay 	
g	so you're heading s-- s-- west but slightly southerly 	
f	yeah 	
g	right 	
g	stop about an inch from the left-hand side of the page 	
f	yeah 	
g	should be at a point about half an inch off the bottom of the page now 	
f	yeah 	
g	right 	
g	now i think we should eh read the banana tree as where the gorillas live so 	
f	right 	
g	erm avoiding the banana tree i suppose 	
g	erm go about 	
f	yeah 	
g	well hang on 	
g	have you got a rope bridge on your map

f	right 	
g	go directly down half an inch 	
f	right 	
g	go to

f	right 	
f	right n-- 	
g	left-hand corner of the white mountain 	
f	right okay 	
f	then i stop 	
g	right

f	so 	
g	just keep going in a straight line don't go into the curve yet until you get to the gazelles 	
f	no 	
f	and then curve round the gazelles 	
g	curve round the gazelles 'til you're facing right now
