f	right 	
g	it goes into a curve d-- goes along the bottom of the page right to about an inch before the edge of the page and it curves right round it's almost like a kind of square circle and it cuts along and it goes it goes up level with the footbridge and goes along the footbridge 	
g	okay

f	down to the side of the crest falls 	
g	right 	
g	just ri-- right down to the bottom of it really 	
g	and then 	
f	right 	
g	along the bottom and then curve up right round past banana tree 	
f	right underneath the footbridge right and along 	
g	right 	
g	right up to the point level with the footbridge 	
f	yeah i'm parallel with the footbridge now 	
f	below it or above it sorry should i be 	
g	eh well you actually need to go across it 	
g	right yeah as if 	
f	oh i'm going along the footbridge 	
f	right sorry okay 	
g	you're walking along it 	
g	is that okay 	
f	yeah sorry 	
g	right see once you've come like if you stop just at the side of the foo-- just at the other edge of the footbridge 	
f	right 	
g	okay 	
g	and we've got a poisoned stream right next to that on the right-hand side 	
g	so we need to drop down about an inch and a half straight down after the footbridge 	
f	straight down 	
g	yeah straight down 	
g	'cause it's right next to it as if we're dropped down between it 	
f	right okay 	
g	okay 	
g	eh drop down about an inch inch and a half 	
f	right 	
g	and then we need to eh go to your your right about two or three inches 	
f	along to the side of the old temple but below it 	
g	yeah now we're 	
g	what's with the old temple right we're going to curve up like ehm curve to go straight up like just before the old temple 	
f	before the old temple 	
g	yeah 	
g	so you're like glancing round it so you just go go in a curve down 	
f	right 	
f	so straight across to the old temple and then up a part 	
g	yeah 	
g	but if you make it a curve instead of like a ti-- a sort of tight angle there 	
f	right okay 	
g	right 	
g	and go about an inch above the old temple just going straight up 	
f	to the side of the straight the slate mountain okay 	
g	yeah 	
g	to the left-hand side of the old temple 	
f	right an inch above it did you say 	
g	okay 	
g	aye about that 	
g	right eh 	
g	there's a kind of hump 	
g	right 	
g	have you got see to the left of where you are right have you got an abandoned truck a good bit to the left 	
f	between th-- 	
f	yeah i have 	
f	but before that i've got a slate mountain 	
g	right well 	
g	i've got a massive big hump here so i i presume that goes round the str-- s-- round the top of the slate mountain 	
f	yeah and right 	
g	if you want to draw like draw a curve round the top of the slate mountain and go down underneath the abandoned truck 	
f	far underneath it or just underneath it 	
g	no 	
g	just underneath the writing 	
f	right 	
g	okay and stop just at the end of the writing abandoned truck 	
f	okay 	
g	okay 	
g	right 	
g	have you got down to your bottom left-hand side of where you are a baboons 	
f	no 	
f	i don't have anything 	
g	right okay 	
g	so 	
g	what we oh heck it's right there's a there's this kind of group of baboons right which is right near the edge but we need to kind of go down underneath them and along to about a half an inch before the edge of the page and then up again so it's like a cup-shaped 	
g	thing really 	
f	sorry how far am i going down to 	
g	you're going down about an inch below the abandoned truck 	
f	under 	
g	right see right 	
f	right 	
g	you're underneath the abandoned truck just now 	
f	the truck 	
f	just like a pr-- 	
g	is that right 	
f	yeah 	
g	and you need to sort of curve straight down to about an about an inch just over an inch below that and straight down a-- and sort of round along for about an inch and then up for about an inch so it's like a cup-shaped 	
f	along to the end of the page 	
g	to the left 	
f	right 	
g	yeah 	
g	and just before the paper say about a half an inch before the paper curve up again 	
f	right 	
g	okay 	
g	right so 	
g	have you got quite a couple of inches above that a thing called white mountain 	
f	yeah 	
g	right 	
g	now we sort of gently slope to the right from where we are up to the left-hand side of the white mountain so you sort of 	
f	above going above the left of the mountain or underneath it 	
g	no 	
g	just along the side of it along the left-hand side of the mountain 	
g	okay 	
g	and then after you to-- the top of the mountain you go straight up for three inches 	
f	straight up towards the lemon grove 	
g	well i don't have a lemon only 	
f	right we need to avoid that 'cause that's straight above the white mountain it's about two to three inches above it 	
g	right 	
g	well maybe go ab-- right if y-- if you avoid that and once you get to the top of that turn right like a sort of right angle turning to the right if you see what i mean 	
f	okay 	
g	right 	
f	to my right yeah 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	and about two and a half inches along from there th-- have you got a pyramid 	
f	pyramid yeah 	
g	right 	
g	we have to go round the outside of the pyramid but you go up-- up the left-hand side down the right-hand side and underneath it right so we're almost doing a triangle 	
f	up and over right 	
g	but underneath that we've got a cobbled street 	
g	have you got that 	
f	no 	
f	i've got a poisoned stream near there 	
g	oh no like my poisoned stream's a lot more to the right but i've got a cobbled street right underneath the pyramid 	
f	no 	
g	right so 	
g	have you have you drawn round the pyramid yet 	
f	yeah 	
f	i've drawn up above it and then down below again 	
g	right 	
g	if you could go along back to your left right to the end of the pyramid 	
f	back to my left 	
g	yeah 	
g	so it's almost as if you're drawing right round it but not quite 	
f	so like a triangle 	
f	right okay 	
g	yeah uh-huh 	
f	right 	
g	right excuse me coughing right 	
g	we've got have you got a remote village further down 	
f	yeah 	
f	quite a bit down 	
g	right okay now 	
g	what we have to do is sort of veer to the left just a wee bit going straight down so that you come down underneath the remote village right and once you get to the 	
g	you know on the left-hand side of it 	
f	right 	
g	okay 	
g	and then what we need to do is turn turn right straight right f-- just 'til you're other side of the remote village and then that's us done 	
f	right i'm down to the side of it 	
f	underneath the poisoned stream sort of roughly 	
g	well eh mine's is in a different position than yours so 	
g	aye probably if yours is 	
f	so the right-hand side of my right-hand side of the remote village is where we end yeah 	
g	yeah 	
g	but you come round the left-hand side underneath it and along to your right 	
f	yeah 	
g	okay 	
f	so i'm sort of directly above the old temple is where i finish 	
g	yeah 	
g	roughly just yeah say maybe just just short of that 	
f	right okay 	
f	yeah well 	
g	okay
