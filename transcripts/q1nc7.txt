g	okay 	
f	right i've done that 	
g	right 	
g	see where the west lake is

f	uh-huh 	
g	can you make it like 	
g	see where you are now you're about an inch away from the abandoned cottage right 	
g	can you make a sort of a wide circle sort of a half circle towards the ehm bottom of that point that curve of west lake 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	right see where the "e" is in west lake 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	in lake 	
g	eh go r-- it's right underneath there 	
g	you know i'm talking about that point 	
g	where it starts to curve like it's to there eh you need a kind of wide ci-- a h-- half circle 	
f	yes 	
f	a w-- 	
g	eh but you're about an inch and a half away from the edge of the page 	
f	what am i avoiding

f	so i'm doing a cir-- 	
g	about a minute 	
f	so see on-- see 	
f	once i've done a circle up to where the 	
g	the west lake is

f	because i just i don't understand 	
f	what way 	
g	right to oh aye to the ehm right 	
g	okay 	
f	so i'm what am i avoi-- you know how i'm curving round what am i avoiding

g	that's what it is that's where the route is 	
f	right 	
g	okay 	
f	right i've done that 	
g	ehm 	
g	so you've curv-- and like you follow the curve of west lake

f	you know 	
f	so i'm like i'm really kind of doubling back on myself a bit 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	you've got you're following to the to the right-hand side you're going right round the right-hand side see right see when you come to the right see right imagine you're at th-- the that point okay underneath the "e" 	
f	right 	
f	i've done 	
g	right 	
f	yes 	
g	at west lake right we're at that corner go round right round the circle 	
f	to the right 	
g	then 	
g	uh-huh to the right 	
g	then up keep going up 	
f	how far 	
f	am i just sort of circling round the west lake 	
g	'til you stop 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	'til you stop 	
g	where it starts you know where it starts eh sort of going sharply to the left in a straight line 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	stop there 	
f	have you got farm land above there as well

g	uh-huh mmhmm so y-- 	
f	about an inch below the farm land right 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	right i've done that 	
g	right 	
g	see beside ehm see where you've stopped then right do you know where that sharp bit is i'm talking about 	
f	just it curves round and then it goes up vertically and then you've i-- 	
g	follow that bit up vertically right 'til it stops going vertically that's what i mean right 	
f	uh-huh i've done that right 	
g	right 	
g	see where you've stopped 	
g	and how you can see a kind of a straight line it's almost a straight line 	
f	mmhmm 	
f	ehm 	
g	to your left in the west lake you know it goes folli-- it's sort of goes up vertically and it goes straight to your left well it goes up a bit 	
f	it goes up vertically then it goes to the left 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	well 	
g	just where it stops going vertically right 	
f	right 	
g	can you see the monument 	
f	i don't have a monument 	
f	oh no i have a mo-- 	
g	you do have a monument it's on the it's on the right-hand side it's to the right-hand side of the page about halfway up 	
f	uh-huh 	
f	away down 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	right 	
g	see where you've stopped 	
g	draw a straight line in that in that in that angle 	
g	see where that that vertical see that ehm 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	that line on the west lake goes sh-- sharply up 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	dra-- draw eh that's it's that angle i'm talking about draw a straight line to the monument from there 	
f	right down to the monument eh 	
g	mmhmm 	
g	on that angle 	
f	and eh 	
f	have you got a golf course 	
g	no 	
g	i take it you're going round the golf course 	
g	just draw a straight line 	
f	no 	
f	the golf course is like nearer the east lake below the east lake so 	
g	ah so it is 	
f	so i would be going to the left-hand side of the golf course 	
g	right 	
g	so where see the monument is 	
g	you're going underneath the monument and up 	
g	okay 	
g	you're curving round the monument 	
f	i'm com-- i'm doing like a i'm drawing a straight line down to the monument and curving r-- 	
g	and go round underneath it 	
f	round the bottom of it 	
g	and curve round the bottom of it uh-huh 	
f	i mean and like you've not got any obstacles here have you below 	
g	no 	
f	between the west lake and the monument 	
g	the west lake and the monument 	
g	i've got a p-- trig point 	
f	where's that so i have i have to avoid it 	
g	that's that's it's abou-- it's okay if you've gone right up towards that if you've gone right up 	
f	but where is it anyway 	
g	where the vertical bit is 	
f	where is it 	
g	see where the west lake is with the writing west lake 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	it's just about two inches away from that beside beside west lake 	
f	okay 	
f	right 	
f	so if i draw down 	
g	you should have curved over it if you had followed that curve west lake 	
f	i will have right uh-huh 	
g	you will right 	
g	and then you go straight it's a total straight line 	
f	a straight line 	
g	going sloping downwards towards the monument 	
f	right 	
f	i've and then curve round the monument 	
g	round the monument 	
f	right 	
g	just right round that 	
f	i've done that 	
g	eh sort of right 	
g	are you at the of top the monument see the guy's head 	
f	yes that's where i am 	
g	right 	
g	stop about there okay curved above it 	
g	ehm you know the east lake is 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	just go vertically up there 	
f	right 	
f	how far 	
g	fact 	
g	i'll tell you what would be even better 	
g	see the the guy's head on the monument the guy's hand sorry 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	where it's pointing right 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	so 	
g	go straight draw the line to you know where your fa-- 	
g	see that curve that you're drawing round the monument 	
g	stop above his hand 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	right 	
f	ah i went a bit further 'cause i thought you said 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	right 	
g	and just c-- and go from there go straight up towards the east lake so you should be directly under the the "e" in lake 	
f	no 	
f	my monument's more to the right of the page than that the east lake's fa-- 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	see the "e" in the word lake 	
f	oh the word the "e" in the word la-- 	
g	the word "e" 	
f	right 	
g	in the lake right

f	mmhmm 	
g	make a dot there right 	
f	direc-- 	
f	directly 	
f	underneath the "e" 	
g	underneath the "e" 	
g	underneath the "e" 	
g	make a dot right beside the lake 	
g	and from the monument the guy's hand on the monument draw a line from that 	
g	okay 	
g	to the east lake and then just follow the curve of the east lake 	
f	right 	
g	so you follow the curve of the east lake to the left 	
g	sorry i've thought it was to the left 	
f	right 	
f	right 	
g	right 	
g	so eh 	
g	you know the bottom left of the east lake 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	about in a centimetre away from that keep drawing a line and then finish it 	
g	okay 	
f	the botto-- wha-- 	
f	say that again 	
g	see the "e" in the east 	
f	yes 	
g	the letter the word east 	
g	underneath that draw a line about an inch away from that okay keep following the coast line 	
g	but don't don't go up don't go up vertically 	
f	right 	
f	don't go up 	
g	you kn-- h-- just go straight along that except carry the line on 	
f	uh-huh 	
f	how far 	
g	for about another centimetre 	
g	and just draw a cross 	
f	a centimetre from the "e" 	
g	mmhmm 	
f	is that all 	
f	right 	
g	mmhmm 	
g	y-- but see where the east lake is see that that kind of line you followed 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	s-- of the lake 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	d-- you haven't gone up have you 	
g	'cause the line goes straight up you know how it goes vertically up 	
f	what with the 	
f	no i haven't done that 	
g	well 	
g	that's okay 	
g	that'll be it finished
