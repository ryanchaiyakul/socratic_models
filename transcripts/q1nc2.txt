f	there's hot springs above me now 	
g	oh 	
f	right 	
g	right 	
g	and you should be kind of ehm two and a half inches away from the right-hand side of the page just now 	
f	oh uh-huh no 	
g	no 	
g	where are you 	
f	my inches must be different from yours 'cause i'm not even halfway across the page 	
f	i should be away at the other s-- side of the page 	
g	you should be kind of at the right-hand side 	
f	how l-- how big's your page 	
g	er 	
f	is it that size 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	uh-huh 	
f	er two and a h-- two 	
g	right 	
g	j-- just go further along then 'til you're 	
f	just go right along 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	so where how far up the the right-hand side should it be 	
g	you shou-- you should be 	
g	ehm 	
f	when i reach the right-hand side how f-- about halfway 	
g	how how do you mean 	
f	er you told me to draw a line going alo-- over to the right-hand side 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	and you should be about two and a half inches fr-- from the right-hand side of the e-- edge of the page 	
f	h-- 	
f	two and a half inches one 	
g	yeah 	
f	two and a half right 	
f	is it sort of just sloping upwards this line 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	kind of gently sloping upwards 	
g	and there's a savannah at the right-hand side of your line just now 	
f	no 	
f	there isn't 	
g	well well 	
g	there is on mine 	
f	there's there's there's a a savannah further down 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	ehm 	
g	well y-- 	
g	you go past 	
f	is the line about halfway up the page just now 	
g	no not quite 	
f	where are 	
g	we're still we're still a bit nearer the bottom 	
f	but 	
f	oh right 	
g	that that line shouldn't have been that long really 	
g	but this this line carries up to about the centre of the page but you're still kind of at the right-hand side kind of vertical line up 	
f	when 	
g	about ehm 	
f	now 	
f	oh right 	
g	yeah and 	
f	a vertical line up 	
g	yeah 	
g	maybe about another two and a half inches 	
f	so i should be f-- more than halfway up the page further 	
g	are you sh-- 	
g	you should be about exactly halfway up the page 	
g	and but you're still kind of at the right-hand side 	
f	i know 	
f	i'm at the i'm about two and a half inches off the right-hand side 	
g	right that's fine 	
f	but i'm mm but i'm too high i think right doesn't matter just 	
g	right okay 	
f	that's me vertically 	
g	right 	
g	and then you go along left about an inch just a straight line 	
g	and underneath there's a a slate mountain 	
f	no 	
f	i don't have a slate mountain i've got a white mountain 	
g	oh right 	
g	ehm after you've gone along your inch you know you start going downwards towards the left ehm 	
f	downwards towards 	
g	a kind of forty-five degree line about an inch and a half down kind of sloping 	
f	right 	
g	and you should be more to the left-hand side of the page now 	
f	er 	
g	kind of just off centre 	
f	yeah 	
g	right 	
f	well 	
f	no 	
f	about i'm about centre never mind 	
g	right that's okay 	
g	and just after you've gone down your slope do another short line about an inch to your left just a straight line along 	
f	right 	
g	and there's some hot wells above this 	
g	no 	
f	no no 	
f	there's some hot springs below but never mind 	
g	oh right erm 	
g	now you should be about maybe two inches from the left-hand side 	
f	no 	
g	no 	
g	where are you 	
f	maybe three and a half 	
f	three and a half inches 	
g	right 	
g	right 	
g	now we're going kind of down about another inch 	
f	am i meant to be a-- away over the left-hand side 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	well 	
f	if i go down an inch i can't 'cause i'll go right through a hot spring i'll need to go further along 	
g	oh 	
f	i'll just take the line further along to the left 	
g	yeah 	
f	right right 	
g	right 	
g	wh-- tell me where are where you are now 	
f	halfway up the page a couple of inches off the left-hand side 	
g	right 	
g	you seem to be kind of down a wee bit i think it doesn't matter 	
g	now 	
g	the line just goes straight up now kind of sloping towards the right 	
f	oh great 	
g	ehm 	
f	through mm-hmm 	
g	but it goes up quite far it goes up goes up to about ehm 	
f	but this is not making sense because i'm just going to be doubling back on myself and there's no like obstacles or anything never mind 	
g	ehm 	
f	what have i to do 	
g	wait a minute 	
g	the line that that i've just done which kind of goes from the right-hand side to the left-hand side is kind of sloping downwards right 	
f	no 	
f	i is it 	
f	yeah 	
g	right 	
g	and that kind of g-- that kind of takes you to th-- to the left-hand side of the page right 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and the line now should be going right up kind of a vertical line 	
f	vertical line 	
g	up quite high it'll go up to about the top third of the page sloping slightly at the end of your line to the right 	
f	what so it's going up vertically and then sloping 	
g	sloping just at the end 	
g	at the right and you should be just about the top third of the page 	
f	ehm no 	
g	no 	
f	i had to avoid a mountain so 	
g	oh is th-- is there a white mountain there 	
f	yes 	
g	yeah you should be kind of 	
f	what sh-- what side should i be 	
g	just at the left of that 	
f	the left-hand side of it 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	yeah i've i've went round the left of that 	
g	oh right okay well 	
f	but i'm a bit high i think 	
g	see the line should kind of slope towards the right 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	level to the top of the mountain 	
g	right 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	and then it should go straight up from there about an inch and a half just a straight line up 	
f	right 	
f	and is there any obstacles there 	
g	no none on mine 	
f	there is on mine there's round rocks 	
g	right 	
f	right i'm going up i've done that 	
g	right 	
g	now you should be about maybe an inch and a half from the top of the page 	
f	yeah well right 	
g	yeah right 	
f	just make it a bit longer 	
g	and then we go about two inches straight along to your right 	
f	is there any obstacles there 	
g	mm no 	
f	right i've done that 	
g	and then ehm just just to the right of this on mine th-- there's a lake 	
f	mmhmm that's right 	
g	is that there 	
g	well you you sh-- you 	
f	it's about the first thing that has 	
g	right and 	
g	you take your line right round the outside of the lake 	
f	the far right 	
f	so i'm going up 	
g	so you're going up 	
g	round 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	down 	
f	right 	
f	just circle the lake 	
g	yeah just uh-huh 	
g	until you're kind of maybe half an inch down from the the left-hand side of the lake 	
g	see what i mean 	
f	mm i so i'm going vertically like the last i'm going round the lake and then taking it down half an inch past the lake taking the line pa-- 	
g	well y-- ehm wait a wee minute 	
g	you don't quite take it 	
g	know where yours says lake 	
f	yeah 	
g	you don't quite take it right round up kind of goes straight along 	
f	oh i see 	
g	see what i mean 	
f	ah well see my line's below well on parallel with the lake so i've had to take it up draw it up and then round 	
g	uh-huh right 	
g	right 	
f	that'll be alright 	
f	so then what do i do 	
g	okay and then underneath this line there's roman baths 	
f	mm 	
g	do you have them 	
f	no 	
g	no 	
g	well 	
g	mine goes after you've taken your li-- rou-- line round it's kind of like a circle but it's it's not joined 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	it goes down maybe 	
f	oh it's nearly like a circle circling right round 	
g	well 	
g	it but it's not joined there's about an inch between the two lines 	
f	oh 	
f	right what what do i do after that 	
g	erm 	
g	see where your your horizontal line at at the top stops just before you go round the lake 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	see if you just go directly down from that erm there should be a vertical line about two and a half inches just at at the beginning of the lake 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	you loop down about an inch below that 	
f	and what about 	
g	carry on your line down about two and a half inches just straight down 	
f	where the lake starts where 	
g	yeah uh-huh wher-- where the lake starts but 	
g	right 	
g	put put your finger on where the lake starts 	
g	right 	
f	where it 	
g	the wee bit that sticks up 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	a-- and go down about an inch 	
f	right 	
g	which is where your line should be kind of passing through 	
f	oh i see i see 	
g	right 	
g	and then from there you kind of go down about two and a half inches 	
f	right okay right 	
g	right 	
g	and do you have antelopes 	
f	yes mmhmm 	
g	it should be kind of erm the line should be going round the antelopes 	
f	what way

f	oh i came o-- okay right 	
g	right 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and just carry on round the antelopes a-- and about an inch and a half just draw a line about an inch and a half to your right and that's your finish
