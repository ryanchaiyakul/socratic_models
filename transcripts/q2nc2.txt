f	right 	
g	on my map i have a telephone kiosk in the bottom left-hand corner 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	okay the route starts above it 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	directly above it about on my map about half an inch from the top of the telephone kiosk 	
f	yeah got you 	
g	okay 	
g	it's a dotted line that moves around to the left of the k-- telephone kiosk down 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	passing around the left-hand side of the stone circle 	
f	stone circle 	
g	yeah 	
f	how don't think i've got that on my map i have a telephone kiosk and a the nearest thing is a broken gate to the bottom right-hand 	
g	yeah 	
g	well under on on my map directly under the telephone kiosk 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	at the right on the bottom left-hand corner of the page i have a stone circle 	
f	yeah 	
f	right 	
g	so if you could take your route straight down 'til about an inch above the bottom of the page 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	okay 	
f	right 	
g	then go straight straight on 	
f	to the r-- 	
g	horizontally about and for about another inch 	
f	to the right 	
g	yeah to the right 	
f	right 	
g	okay 	
f	okay 	
g	now if you move straight up you're going to be on the left-hand side of that farmer's gate 	
f	right 	
g	that correct 	
f	yeah 	
g	okay 	
g	if you move straight up until you're at the top left-hand corner of the broken gate 	
f	mmhmm 	
f	right 	
g	okay 	
g	now we're going to move do you have a meadow in the bottom right-hand corner 	
f	meadow yeah uh-huh 	
g	okay 	
g	now you're going to move in a diagonal line 	
g	do you have little seagulls drawn on it 	
f	no not at all 	
g	little birds 	
g	okay 	
f	oh yeah sorry i do yeah 	
g	no you do 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	well i've got five little birds on mine 	
f	yeah just above the meadow 	
g	okay 	
f	right 	
g	so if you take the middle bird 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	and you move up the page until you're probably about to a point that's about half an inch horizontally higher than the point you're at at the farmer's gate 	
f	right 	
g	okay 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	now if you take your route from where you are now to that point 	
f	right 	
g	diagonally upwards 	
f	right 	
g	okay we're going to move up from there to the ruined monastery 	
f	right 	
g	and your route's 	
f	h-- have you got overnight accommodation on yours 	
g	no i don't 	
f	well i've got overnight accommodation in a diagonal line between the ruined monastery and the point i'm at just now 	
g	in a diagonal line 	
f	yeah 	
f	it's about if upwards was north it would be northwest of where i am just now 	
g	yeah oh that sounds that sounds like the same route that i have here 	
g	does that take you up to the top right-hand corner say of the the ruined monastery you know just off the ruined monastery 	
f	erm well 	
g	by that pa-- 	
f	if i was goi-- to go up in a straight line just now i'd end up slightly to the right of the ruined monastery 	
g	okay 	
g	well it's slightly diagonally northwest as you said 	
f	yeah well that's through the overnight accommodation then 	
g	well that's that'd be good 	
f	i don't suppose that's an obstacle really 	
g	no 	
g	that'd be quite good actually 	
f	right go straight through it then 	
g	yeah 	
g	we're going right up there and around the top of the ruined monastery curving round the top 	
f	curving round the top the right-hand side or the left-hand side 	
g	oh we're coming up you're coming up on the right-hand side 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and you're going over to the left-hand side and down 	
f	right 	
g	so it's curved down towards the west lake 	
f	sorry where am i going from the point just now just up northwest 	
g	up northwest 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	say to the top right-hand corner of the ruined monastery 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	okay and you're going to draw like a small arch just skimming round the outside of it 	
f	right 	
f	right 	
f	to the left 	
g	an arch 	
g	down to the left yes 	
f	yeah 	
g	okay 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	now you're going to keep moving downwards like in an arc 	
f	yeah 	
g	around the edge of the west lake 	
g	do you have the west lake on yours 	
f	nope not at all no 	
g	okay 	
g	let me see 	
g	now you've skimmed an arch around the top of the ruined monastery 	
f	yeah 	
g	come down about an inch keep the keep the arc coming down for about an inch 	
f	mmhmm 	
f	right 	
g	past the bottom of the ruined monastery 	
f	right 	
g	okay now you're going to curve it back 	
g	do you have a stile 	
g	up to 	
f	eh yeah uh-huh 	
g	yeah 	
f	yeah 	
g	well if you can curve it round until a point that's directly below the left-hand corner of the stile 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and then move straight upwards towards the left-hand side skim round the left-hand side of the stile 	
f	am i doing an arc eh that's curving up and over to the left 	
g	yeah 	
g	you've just done one that's curved down 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	from the ruined monastery and you're curving back up now towards the stile 	
f	right 	
g	on the left-hand side of it 	
f	yeah 	
f	right i'm there 	
g	okay come over the top 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and then once you're past the stile go straight up about two inches 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	okay 	
f	yeah 	
g	right at this point across t-- and down to the right-hand side of your page do you have a dead tree 	
f	eh no 	
f	i have a dutch elm but erm 	
g	well that's 	
f	is that the dead tree 	
g	possibly 	
g	yeah 	
g	above 	
f	well it's on the very far right-hand side of the page though 	
g	right 	
g	yeah 	
g	on the ri-- dilect directly right across from where you are do you have a great viewpoint a drawing of a telescope i have here 	
f	eh it's directly above where i am just now directly above the stile about four inches 	
g	yeah i've got that 	
g	i've got another one across to the right 	
f	no i haven't got that one 	
g	okay 	
g	and do you have the east lake up in the top right-hand corner 	
f	uh-huh 	
f	yeah 	
g	where you are just now should be horizontally across from say just below the bottom right-hand tip of it that's how high you should be on the map 	
f	the great viewpoint 	
g	no 	
g	no from the ea-- the bottom right-hand corner of the east lake 	
f	bottom right-hand corner uh-huh 	
g	okay 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	now you should be say about a half an inch below that only across the other side of the page 	
f	yeah got that exactly yeah 	
g	excellent 	
g	now you see where the ruined monastery is 	
f	yeah uh-huh 	
g	back to the ruined monastery again 	
f	straight line up 	
g	and you've got you've got an elm tree sort of just off to the right of that 	
f	oh right 	
f	yeah uh-huh 	
g	okay 	
g	what we're going to do then is draw a diagonal line from where you are now 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	down to a point that goes around the outside of the elm tree 	
f	right 	
f	i've got a popular tourist spot erm between the dutch elm and where i am just now 	
g	do you 	
f	yeah 	
f	so go straight through that 	
g	yeah go straight through it 	
f	towards the dutch elm 	
g	yeah 	
f	and which side of the dutch elm should i end up on 	
g	y-- you're going to draw a line around the outside of it so you should be underneath the dutch elm 	
f	right 	
f	so i'm drawing a line around the top of the dutch elm ending up at underneath it 	
g	yeah that's right 	
f	right 	
f	right 	
g	we're going to curve around the outside of the elm 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	okay 	
f	i've done that yeah 	
g	now 	
g	this dutch elm you have if you look across the page to the stile again 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	is it beneath the stile or 	
f	slightly beneath it the base of the dutch elm is about maybe half an inch below the bottom of the stile 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	and away f-- is it about an inch away from the right-hand side of the page 	
f	yeah uh-huh 	
g	oh must be the same tree i would think anyway 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	sounds similar 	
g	okay you're going to come around the outside of that 	
f	yeah 	
g	you'll be about an inch away from the right-hand s-- edge of the page 	
f	right 	
g	okay 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and you're going to come back in as if you'd drawn about two thirds of a circle around the tree just about 	
f	right got you 	
g	okay 	
f	yeah 	
g	now 	
g	you don't have a telescope between you and the the east lake no 	
f	no 	
g	a great viewpoint 	
g	do you have any kind of marking at all 	
f	i've 	
f	rocket launch pad 	
g	a rocket launch pad 	
f	yeah 	
g	excellent 	
g	eh no i don't have a rocket launch pad on mine 	
g	but i don't think that would be a tremendously good place to go through 	
f	no 	
g	right 	
g	okay 	
g	do you have east lake written on the east lake 	
f	uh-huh yeah 	
g	yeah 	
g	see where the "e" is 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	erm if you draw a line if you are just about directly beneath that "e" 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	okay draw a line up to the water's edge maybe just to the right of that "e" 	
f	s-- straight up 	
g	straight up yeah 	
f	just slightly to the right of the "e" 	
g	mmhmm 	
g	until you're just like virtually on the water's edge 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	okay 	
f	right 	
g	now mark your route along the water's edge to a point that's just past the sort of bottom left-hand edge of it 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	okay 	
g	that's pointing 	
f	bottom left-hand edge 	
g	yeah 	
g	if if your line is pointing you-- you're not we're not going to take it that far but if your line is pointing towards the great viewpoint which is on the top left-hand corner 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	and you're still underneath the east lake then that's you 	
f	right 	
f	right got you 	
g	"x" marks the spot and we're finished 	
f	so where am i going now to the great viewpoint 	
g	that's you 	
g	no that's you
