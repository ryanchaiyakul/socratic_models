g	then that's where your start is 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	right 	
f	that's right 	
g	okay well 	
g	you need to go ehm travel left about an inch and then go down along the side of the missionary camp so you're going downwards just running along parallel to it 	
f	right okay 	
g	okay 	
g	down so that you're about an inch above the bottom of the map 	
f	right 	
g	okay 	
g	now 	
g	you have you got a some gorillas over on the left 	
f	no 	
f	i've got a banana tree though 	
g	alright that's probably 	
g	do you think that's probably the same 	
f	yeah that's probably about it 	
g	mm yeah 	
g	so you just need to run along the bottom of the map until you get to just below the gorillas or the banana tree 	
f	right er we'll probably have to take it down a wee bit further for for that 	
g	right okay 	
f	right nothing else kind of down there 	
g	right 	
f	and i want to stop directly below 	
g	yeah 	
g	well 	
g	actually you need to then you need to bend up round the side of the gorillas so you're then going along so you're running parallel with the eh left-hand side of the map 	
f	mmhmm 	
f	right that's okay 	
g	okay 	
g	so you then go upwards about 	
g	and then have you got a rope bridge 	
f	yeah 	
g	right 	
g	you need to run up vertically until you become parallel with the rope bridge 	
f	oh i've taken it over much further than that i'm kind of almost at the edge of the page so 	
g	ah right 	
f	is it okay is it safe enough to head diagonally across 	
g	yeah 	
g	if you head diagonally across to the beginning of the rope bridge 	
f	right okay 	
g	and then you you're walking across the rope bridge so your line will stop and then start coming out at the other side of the rope bridge 	
f	right fine 	
g	okay 	
g	down about an inch so you come you've come off the rope bridge and you drop down about an inch 	
f	right 	
f	erm i don't know if i can do that without going in the river actually 	
g	oh yeah 	
g	i for-- yeah there's a river isn't there 	
g	well 	
g	if you just take it so that you're running alongside the river 	
f	just right along the edge of the river 	
g	yeah so you need to run alongside the river for about um three or four inches 	
f	right okay 	
g	and then 	
g	you have got a waterfall on the right-hand side 	
f	yeah 	
g	well then um 	
g	just 'til when you're about ehm level with the b-- with the bottom of the waterfall

g	where are you at the moment 	
f	um d-- just stop beside the waterfall that's right over on the right-hand side 	
g	yeah 	
g	right you need to go upwards until you're level with the fallen pillars 	
f	right okay 	
g	okay 	
f	fine 	
g	and then imagine that you had 	
g	you see the lost steps at the top 	
f	yes 	
g	if you imagine that they were there just where you've stopped 	
f	mmhmm

g	so you you're going u-- 	
f	right 	
f	so which way am i heading then left or right 	
g	right 	
g	you're going left towards the fallen pillars
