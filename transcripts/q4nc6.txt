g	do the same distance again between that in fact a wee bit more i'd say about twelve thirteen centimetres down to the bottom 	
f	down 	
g	right 	
f	right okay 	
g	so you should be about a centimetre away from the left-hand side of the page and about two s-- two or three centimetres above the bottom 	
f	the bottom of the page 	
g	right 	
f	oh wait a minute wh-- fr-- how many centimetres from the w-- 	
g	about one centimetre from the left-hand side of the page

g	you've just g-- really got a straight line down from the start missing the camera shop 	
f	right aye right i've got it 	
g	okay eh now i've got a parked van here so i'm just trying to go round it you're sort of doing a "u" shape back round past where my parked van is so just go east for about four five centimetres 	
f	right okay 	
g	right 	
g	so you're going aiming towards the yacht club but you're going nowhere near as far as that 	
g	right 	
f	right 	
f	so i'm just like below the allotments just now 	
g	below it not as far along as that 	
g	are you at whereabouts what letter are you under in the allotments

f	no i'm no i'm just actually 	
g	all right 	
f	just before it i'm not actually touched the allotments yet 	
g	all right that's good that's good 	
g	because what you're doing is you're going up the side of the allotments 	
f	right okay i'm just 	
g	so you're doing you're continuing that "u" shape from where you were at the start you're sort of going back up heading north towards the side of the allotments 	
g	right 	
f	right 	
g	see the wee black house at the left-hand side of the allotments 	
f	am i just going straight up 	
g	yes straight up f-- from there right 	
f	right 	
f	is that all right 	
f	right okay right 	
g	right so you're at the s-- you're at the 	
f	i'm at the wee black house now at the left of the allotments

g	so have you got a sort of "u"-shaped a sort of half "u" shape 	
f	yeah 	
g	right that's okay that's fine 	
f	okay 	
g	right this is where it gets difficult 	
g	eh 	
f	right 	
g	'cause you're aiming into the middle of nowhere there's about 	
g	i've got a yacht club right 	
g	at the bottom right-hand side 	
f	ehm 	
f	uh-huh right 	
g	right 	
g	see if you forget about the line for a minute if you pick a point about sssh 	
g	see the edge of the left-hand yacht right 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	the bottom edge of it the corner 	
f	right 	
g	if you aim above that for about six centimetres right 	
f	right 	
g	a point up there 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	if you can draw a diagonal line from the wee black house in the allotments up to the top up to the where that point is about six centimetres 	
f	a-- have you got a flight museum 	
g	i've not no 	
g	have you got a flight museum in the middle somewhere

f	i've got a flight 	
f	right 	
f	if i go up from the bottom left-hand corner of this yacht if i go up about six centimetres 	
g	right 	
f	i'm just like about one centimetre from this to the left of this eh to the right of this flight museum 	
g	one centimetre to the right o-- 	
f	but i suppose ehm i suppose if i draw a line from that wee house it might just miss the flight museum 	
g	i think that's o-- pff 	
g	right well what you're doing is you're drawing a line it's not exactly eh east right it's sort of between two and three o'clock it's very very gradual incline up for about fourteen centimetres twelve 	
f	right i n-- i know what i know what what you're doing 	
g	see what i'm

f	right okay 	
g	eh you've got the alpine garden at the top le-- eh you're at the top left of the alpine garden right 	
f	right that's me 	
g	you're under "n" or "c" or something like that of picket fence 	
f	uh-huh 	
f	right 	
g	eh what you're doing now is you're going along to the right just above the top of the alpine garden whatever those if that's weeds or something eh you're going along for two to three centimetres 	
g	okay 	
f	right so i'm going to the right of the alpine garden a-- the top of it 	
g	uh-huh to the right uh-huh 	
g	the top just straight across right 	
f	right okay

g	right 	
g	so you should be sort of halfway between your alpine garden and your parked van really if you know what i mean 	
f	ah right okay i'll go up a wee bit 	
g	right is that right round about there 	
f	i'll go up a wee bit further 	
f	right okay that's about it

f	right okay 	
g	just a straight line right for two centimetres 	
f	so have you got this parked van

g	right okay so you're about two to three centimetres below the parked van at the moment 	
f	uh-huh that's me 	
g	just right right 	
g	you've got that point there now you've got your telephone box right 	
f	aye 	
g	see the letter "t" 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	draw a line from where you are at the moment diagonally right down it's a southeast 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	it's a big massive diagonal line it's about fifteen centimetres long or something like that 	
f	right down to the b-- 	
g	right down to the letter "t" right down to the bottom 	
f	t-- to the top of it 	
f	or the bottom of it right okay 	
g	to the bottom of it sorry 	
g	just underneath the letter "t" 	
g	okay 	
f	right that's me 	
g	right 	
g	and then all you

g	eh 	
f	we're at the bottom of the "t" 	
g	we're underneath the letter "t" at the moment 	
g	go along just sort of underline telephone box just a t-- a fraction underneath telephone underline it right to the letter "x" 	
f	right 	
g	right 	
f	right okay 	
g	and you just go to the edge of the letter "x" 	
g	right 	
f	right 	
g	you're on the right-hand side of it 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	then all you're doing is going up for about another three centimetres to just just above the top of the telephone box 	
f	right 	
g	about half a centimetre above the top of the telephone box 	
g	okay 	
f	right 	
g	now this is where you've not got a thatched mud hut 	
f	oh 	
g	eh you've got an east lake haven't you 	
f	aye 	
g	right uh-huh 	
f	away at the top 	
f	of the page yeah 	
g	eh well what you're wanting to do is you see the bottom of the east lake the the line that's going down sort of diagonally sort of 	
f	uh-huh 	
f	the bottom right-hand corner 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	well you're wanting see the "k" of lake 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	you're wanting to end up just about half a centimetre away from the bottom of the lake itself but underneath the letter "k" 	
g	right 	
f	right okay 	
g	but don't draw a straight diagonal line 	
g	okay 	
g	because you want to from where you are just now you're above the telephone box that right 	
f	right 	
f	uh-huh i'm above the telephone box 	
g	you're wanting to sort of go it's a sort of curve aiming to the left and then going straight north 	
g	do you know what i mean it's like th-- the left-hand side of a "u" or something like that right 	
f	right 	
g	you're at the bottom of 	
f	have y-- have you got this le-- 	
f	oh you've not got this level crossing on have you 	
g	i've not got a level crossing no 	
f	right okay 	
f	so whe-- whereabouts is this mud m-- m-- m-- this thatched mud hut 	
g	eh so you're 	
g	mu-- thatched mud hut it's directly above the telephone box at the moment 	
g	so that's what you're trying to avoid if you can imagine a thatched mud hut sort of halfway between the telephone box and the bottom right-hand corner of the east lake 	
g	right you're sort of going left 	
f	right 	
f	so i'm wanting to go left 	
g	and then north up to just below the "k" but on the don't go into the lake just stay outside it 	
f	right okay 	
f	i kind of right i see that's that there right 	
g	right 	
g	do you sort of see where i'm going 	
f	i know you're going 	
g	so you should have a sort of a "u" shape there 	
f	but i've got this stupid level crossing 	
g	oh forget it oh you can go-- you can walk across that 	
f	right i'll just go up this side of it right 	
f	i think i've missed it 	
g	right 	
g	right okay 	
f	right 	
g	and then you're so you're just underneath the bottom 	
f	i'm about ha-- i'm about ya-- under the "k" 	
g	right that's right 	
f	i'm not in the lake though 	
g	that's right 	
g	just you know the bottom of the lake it's sort of going diagonally 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	follow that the bottom of the lake right up keep about half a centimetre away from it and follow it up to the left 	
g	right 	
g	to the bottom corner of the lake the pointy bit 	
g	see it 	
f	oh right this i-- this is to the left this is towards the parked van 	
g	have you got a pointy bit 	
g	yes this is t-- aiming towards the parked van 	
f	right okay right okay 	
g	so you're right under the bottom corner at the moment 	
f	uh-huh 	
f	right 	
g	and just continue that line for about another centimetre and that's the finish just in the exact same 	
f	just below that wee bump 	
g	that's be-- just below the wee bump that's it 	
f	right okay 	
g	exactly 	
g	and that's it 	
f	right 	
f	ah 	
g	that's it very good 	
f	no problem
