f	uh-huh 	
g	okay 	
f	downwards 	
g	downwards sort of skipping 	
f	to the left-hand side 	
g	yeah 	
g	down until you're about an inch from the bottom of the page you should be skipping the edge of the page by about half an inch 	
g	okay 	
f	okay 	
g	now take it do you have a stone circle at the bottom 	
f	no 	
g	no you don't 	
g	okay 	
g	now are you like if you come in a wee bit so that you're about an inch away from both edges 	
f	okay 	
g	okay 	
g	if you get to that point 	
f	okay 	
g	now move along about an inch 	
f	to the right 	
g	to the right 	
g	directly horizontally across 	
f	okay 	
g	okay 	
g	now curve up and out a wee bit and then straight up 	
f	up and up and left or right 	
g	so that you're 	
g	see where your farmer's gate is 	
f	right 	
g	okay 	
g	we're going to come up on the left-hand side of that you'll just skim it by about a centimetre 	
g	okay 	
f	up and to the right 	
g	up to the left-hand side of it yeah until you're at the top left-hand corner of the drawing 	
f	of the broken gate 	
g	of the broken gate that's correct 	
f	okay

f	sorry have i to go round the top of it 	
g	no no 	
g	don't don't draw anything yet 	
g	just like say with your finger an imaginary point 	
f	above the third seagull 	
g	above the seagull so that both like your pen 	
g	and your finger are level 	
f	okay 	
f	right 	
g	okay 	
f	okay 	
g	now if you raise your right this imaginary point up about three quarters of an inch say 	
g	okay 	
f	okay 	
g	see the point you're at there 	
g	draw a diagonal line linking these two points 	
f	okay 	
f	right 	
g	okay 	
g	now 	
g	do you have a ruined monastery 	
f	eh not near where i am just now 	
f	it's in the middle of the page 	
g	yeah 	
g	right up at the middle of the page 	
f	yeah 	
g	okay 	
g	now if you say put make a point that that's just off the top right-hand turret or whatever it is you know just the top right-hand edge of that 	
f	okay yeah 	
g	it's about a centimetre off it 	
f	okay 	
g	okay 	
g	if you draw a kind of diagonal line curving yourself 	
f	round the monastery down to where i was 	
g	eh just from that edge to where you were 	
f	right okay 	
f	do you have the overnight accommodation 	
g	no 	
g	but you can go through that 	
f	okay 	
f	okay okay 	
g	okay 	
f	right 	
g	now do you have the west lake down to your left 	
f	no 	
g	okay 	
g	right if you draw like a curved arch from the point you're at eh over the top of the the ruins 	
f	right 	
g	okay 	
g	back down to like say a point that's level only on the other side 	
g	okay 	
f	right 	
g	right 	
g	what you're going to do is you're going to continue your downward line for about another inch moving down towards let me see in a compass direction it would be southwest 	
g	right just continue down the way 	
f	right 	
f	okay 	
g	moving both outwards and downwards 	
f	right 	
g	okay 	
g	now skim a line that's pointing diagonally up if you take a point about an inch and a half from the edge of the page 	
f	level with where i am 	
g	level from where you are 	
g	okay 	
f	okay 	
g	then move that point up half an inch so you've got a kind of diagonal line again 	
f	right 	
g	okay this is the left-hand edge of the page yeah 	
f	yeah okay 	
g	okay 	
g	if you connect these two points 	
f	okay 	
g	do you have a stile above you 	
f	yeah 	
g	okay 	
g	are you downwards and slightly to the left of the stile 	
f	i'm down and about an inch to the left 	
g	an inch to the okay 	
g	you could come in a wee bit so that when you go up you uh you go up to the top left-hand corner of the stile but you're only say about a centimetre from the edge so that's your line 	
f	okay 	
g	your point should be downwards you probably got the distance correct down the way but that'll be your route 	
f	up to the top of the stile 	
g	yeah 	
g	top left-hand corner 	
f	okay 	
g	now if you like sort of draw a line along the top of that as if we're skirting round the ex-- the edge of it 	
f	okay 	
g	again now we're going to move straight up about an inch and a half 	
f	from the right-hand corner of the stile 	
g	i've 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	do you have an obstacle there 	
f	i've got a popular tourist spot slightly to the right and up from the stile 	
g	okay 	
g	now we go up 	
g	right so you're at a point that's probably about two to three inches away from both the top edge and the left-hand side edge is that correct 	
f	no not at the moment 	
g	no 	
g	right can you see that point well if you imagine a point 	
f	up in the top left-hand corner 	
g	right the top left-hand corner 	
g	if you come down about three inches 	
f	aye right okay 	
g	okay 	
f	i've got i've got 	
g	and you come in about three inches okay there's a point 	
f	i've got a great viewpoint there 	
g	oh wait a minute 	
f	okay 	
g	no no 	
g	i've got a great viewpoint away up in the top left-hand corner 	
f	yeah 	
f	that's what i thought you were talking about 	
g	no 	
g	if you diagonally if you came in the same distance again 	
g	do you get it sh-- 	
g	oh wait a minute what would that be hold on 	
g	one two three say four inches ac-- in fact chris 	
f	okay 	
g	four inches away from the top edge four inches away from the the edge on the left-hand side 	
f	right 	
g	now on my map that should be that's like up from the stile 	
f	right 	
g	okay 	
g	now if you're at that point do you have a a dead tree it's an elm tree down to your 	
f	yeah 	
f	right over the other side of the page 	
g	okay 	
g	now see there the letter "d" 	
f	mmhmm

g	dutch elm 	
g	is it written underneath the tree 	
f	yeah 	
g	okay 	
g	see the first letter of dutch say 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	okay about a centimetre below that 	
f	right 	
g	okay if you draw a line is that a can you ha-- have a diagonal line going from where you are right down to 	
f	yeah 	
g	yeah 	
g	do you go through anything 	
f	no 	
g	okay 	
g	see the popular viewpoint what happened to it did we go round it or what 	
f	no we just stayed away from it 	
g	oh never went anywhere near it 	
f	no w-- well we went round the popular tourist spot we avoided the great viewpoint 	
g	yeah okay went round that that's fine 	
g	okay you're going to curve half a circle around that tree 	
f	up the way 	
g	up the way 	
g	so that 	
g	see the third branch from the left 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	until you're say above that that's your half circle 	
f	okay 	
g	okay you've done a "u" turn 	
g	now 	
g	if you draw like a kind 	
g	let's see 	
g	see where you have the east lake at the top 	
f	yeah 	
g	right if you draw a line if you go from the "e" in lake down the way 	
g	okay 	
f	okay 	
g	on to the edge of the lake 	
f	right 	
g	and then say about half a centimetre from the edge of the lake if you connect those two points 	
f	okay 	
g	now skirt the edge of the lake to the left move left along the edge of the lake 	
f	okay 	
g	for about three inches 	
f	to the corner 	
g	yeah to the corner 	
g	so you're just past go past that co-- don't go up or anything like that just go past the corner for about an inch 	
f	okay
