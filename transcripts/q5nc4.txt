f	right 	
g	right 	
f	uh-huh yeah 	
g	right now 	
f	okay 	
g	you're going to form another outward curve like half a circle 	
f	mmhmm

f	mmhmm 	
f	so where am i heading 	
g	right are you ne-- a--

g	right 	
g	you're going to go straight down this time for about four centimetres 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	right 	
f	yeah 	
g	you're going to form another slight curve ehm another circle but you're going to do it ehm ehm convex towards the page like outward an outward you're forming the outward ehm form of a circle here a minute 	
g	no mmhmm 	
g	right 	
g	go go ehm three centimetres to the left again no wait a minute where are we three centimetres to the right 	
f	i'm going to go off the edge of the page here 	
g	right are you near wheatfields 	
f	no 	
g	no right 	
g	go back 'til you're sort of like middle of the page right 	
f	right mm 	
g	but down slightly but you're sort of still in the middle of the page

f	i go round the the far side of the bakery and then head towards the s-- second peak of crane bay 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	shi-- right sort of trace that sort of ehm bevelled shape in crane crane bay and you want to get to the second peak of crane bay 	
g	right 	
f	eh yeah i think so i'm getting there 	
g	the one that's towards the right 	
f	yeah 	
g	okay 	
g	right
