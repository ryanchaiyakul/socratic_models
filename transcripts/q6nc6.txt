who	$m	
g	right ehm 	
g	we're at the start 	
f	right 	
f	i'll write start in 'cause it's off the top of my thing 	
g	right 	
g	it's actually off the top of mine as well 	
f	right 	
f	let's start 	
g	y-- you got the diamond mine 	
f	re-- yeah 	
g	right you just want to go along to the left of the diamond mine well just down from the start so you're underneath the diamond mine 	
f	down down the left-hand side 	
g	yeah 	
g	so you're underneath and 	
g	then 	
f	right 	
f	right 	
f	i'm right underneath the centre of the diamond mine 	
g	uh-huh that's right yeah 	
g	now 	
g	you've you sh-- you've not got a wagon wheel no 	
f	no 	
g	what've you got between the diamond mine and the rift valley 	
f	where's rift valley 	
g	up at the top right 	
f	a cactus 	
g	you've got a cactus 	
g	and is that in a sort of 	
f	it's it's underneath it 	
f	it's it's 	
g	un-- 	
g	underneath the rift valley 	
f	undernea-- it's underneath the left-hand side of the valley 	
f	you know how the valley sort of dips 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	right 	
f	on the left-hand side there's a wee cactus up the top 	
g	oh right 	
f	it's it's right underneath that 	
g	right 	
g	well you want to go on a slight a a s-- well a slight gradient upwards to to your right 	
f	right 	
g	eh so you're just past the centre of the map i would say 	
f	right 	
g	ehm you should be a wee bit past the centre of the map 	
g	now 	
g	you want to go ehm just s-- straight up and then round so you go over the top of the rift valley and then down through the centre of it 	
f	down through the centre 	
g	yeah you want to go down through the centre of the rift valley 	
f	right so i've done that 	
g	right 	
g	now 	
g	have you got you've got rocks right uh eh underneath 	
f	i've got rocks 	
f	yeah 	
g	you want you want to go straight down and then sort of uh ehm half way curve out slightly so you go past diagonally past the rocks to the left-hand side you're missing them by few centimetres 	
f	right i'm at the bottom of the rocks i've done that 	
g	you're at the bottom of the rocks 	
g	right now 	
g	you you've not got a stone creek to the left of the rocks have you 	
f	a what 	
g	a stone creek 	
f	i've got rapids 	
g	ehm that's to the left and slightly underneath the rocks is it 	
f	uh-huh 	
f	yeah 	
g	right 	
g	well you want to go 	
f	is directly underneath the diamond mine 	
g	uh-huh that's right 	
g	you want to go down slightly from from the rock level and then curve back up and go over the the rapids so you're on s-- sort of directly on top of them 	
f	right so i'm over them 	
g	right 	
g	now 	
g	you want to eh curve down to your at at the side of the at the rapids a few centimetres out from them 	
f	how many 	
g	ehm sort of five centimetres 	
g	just so you're 	
f	shit 	
g	you see the line ehm so you're basically in a line with the end of the very end of the swamp 	
g	you want to go out that far 	
g	and then 	
g	we're eh straight down slightly curved shape a sort of eye shape so you come you come down to 	
g	you got stone slabs 	
f	yeah 	
g	you want to be 	
f	i've also got a manned fort 	
g	right well 	
g	you want to go straight down i don't know miss your manned fort and s-- the level you want to get to in this sort of curve is it should be directly 	
f	am i going in a curve 	
g	a slight curve basically s-- basically straight down and then curve slightly so you're eh right underneath the white water and just slightly above the level of the stone slabs it should be in the sort of shape of an eye 	
g	you know the sideways shape of an eye you get at school 	
g	that sort of idea of a curve 	
g	right are you there 	
f	right i'm underneath the manned fort on a level 	
f	have you got stone creek 	
g	yeah 	
g	you should be above stone creek 	
f	right 	
f	that's where i am 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	on the same level as the stone slabs 	
g	right 	
g	now uh 	
g	have you got to your right underneath the rocks have you got an outlaws' hideout 	
f	saloon bar 	
f	ah outlaws' hideout yeah 	
f	it's above them 	
g	yeah it's 	
f	it's above the rocks above the gold mine 	
g	the gold mine 	
f	i've got a gold mine 	
g	oh right ehm 	
f	just it's no it's it's just below the rocks 	
g	below the rocks right 	
f	there's outlaws' hideout 	
g	tha-- uh-huh that's right that's right below the rocks 	
g	you want to go up eh in a fairly sort of well just a sort of logical gradient so you're underneath the outlaws' hideout just right underneath it 	
f	right i'm there 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	now 	
g	have you have you got a noose below the outlaws' hideout 	
f	uh-huh 	
f	there's a gold mine though 	
f	above the right above the noose just just right below the outlaws' hideout slightly it's it's directly above the noose 	
g	right 	
g	right 	
g	well 	
g	you want to curve out slightly so you're to the right of the the gold mine and to the right of the noose and then just come straight down to the bottom eh right of the noose 	
f	right that's where i am 	
g	s-- right 	
g	now 	
g	you want to keep curving down to well basically keep curving down 'til you're above 	
g	you've not got you've not got a swan pond no 	
f	a what 	
g	you've not got a swan pond 	
f	no 	
g	right well 	
g	you want to keep curving down you're at the bottom right of the noose you want to curve down so you're just a-- ehm sort of a few centimetres five centimetres from maybe above the end 	
g	you know the writing at the bottom the "n" "a" "q" "c" "6" stuff 	
f	yeah 	
g	you want to be just above that and your level is about roughly the middle of the saloon bar has your level 	
f	right i'm there 	
g	right 	
g	now 	
g	a few centimetres to the left of that i've got the swan pond 	
f	how many roughly 	
g	ehm don't don't write anything yet by the way ehm 	
g	i'm talking about three centimetres 	
g	probably 	
f	right 	
g	i see so you've got to basically from where you are go along very slightly and then curve up over the swan pond and then back down to the same level that you're at so the curve you want to get is basically to the top of the saloon bar is the level curve up there and then curve down ehm about well see you're 	
f	how long is this swan 	
g	right 	
g	the end of it is at directly down from the end of the stone slabs 	
f	right 	
f	so i've got that and then i go down to where i was 	
g	y-- no n-- aye the level you were yeah that's right 	
f	right 	
g	and from there you want to curve eh so you're underneath the saloon bar 	
f	underneath it 	
g	yeah 	
f	right 	
f	i'm underneath the "o" 	
g	and then 	
g	right you're underneath the "o" 	
g	right well 	
g	basically this is the bit i messed up a bit last time 	
g	the finish is just keeping going to your left and curving up past the saloon bar and it's a few ce-- it's about three or f-- maybe four centimetres out five centimetres out from the left-hand side of your page and it's just above the roof of the saloon bar and that's the finish
