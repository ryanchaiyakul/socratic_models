g	eh 	
f	okey-dokey 	
g	until you've just got past the edge of the crest falls 	
f	right 	
g	and then 	
g	come down until you reach a an angle maybe just past south towards west slightly past until you reach the bottom of crest falls and le-- a level with the "c" and maybe about an inch to west of the "c" 	
f	mm 	
f	okey-dokey 	
g	right 	
g	and then go due west until about two centimetres from the edge of the paper 	
f	right 	
g	now 	
g	do you have a footbridge 	
f	n-- just north of the banana tree 	
f	yeah 	
g	right 	
g	go up north now until you're just due north until you're just below the the level of the footbridge 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and then from there go over right to the edge of the the the western side of footbridge 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	right 	
g	and then the path s-- the path starts again at the other side of the footbridge 	
g	now 	
g	do you have a poisoned stream there 	
f	no not at all 	
g	well 	
g	just at the the footbridge next to when you come off there's a poisoned stream 	
g	so when you come off the footbridge you have to go due south maybe about an inch and a half 	
f	right 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	and then 	
g	och t-- take a wee bit more to be safe just a wee touch more 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and then do you have an old temple

g	right 	
g	go along eastward for about two inches 	
f	mmhmm

f	eh slate mountain 	
g	right

f	mmhmm 	
g	ehm 	
g	loo-- go two and a half inches up over the temple the up the side of it 	
f	right 	
g	and then 	
g	and then say an angle of northwest forty-five degrees 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	go up for about two inches that would probably take you past the top of the 	
f	up past the truck and the mountain 	
g	something uh-huh 	
f	right 	
g	and then b-- back down at the same angle to well the opposite angle anyway to get you down to th-- your abandoned truck just below it 	
f	right 	
g	and then go straight across the bottom of the abandoned truck 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	until you're just below the "a" 	
f	right 	
g	now

g	uh then 	
f	right 	
g	do you have a white mountain further up 	
f	yes 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	right 	
g	now 	
g	well the best thing to do first of all would be come back up to where you were at the "a" and the come up to make that a "u" shape 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and then 	
g	draw a line straight between this point and maybe about half a centimetre to the west of the bottom of the white mountain 	
f	right 	
g	right 	
g	now mm 	
g	go up the side of the mountain until you're maybe follow the side for up until about half an inch below the summit 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and then change to going due north for about three inches 	
f	up past the lemon grove 	
g	ah there's no lemon grove in this one 	
f	right 	
g	right

f	mmhmm 	
g	yeah 	
g	now

f	mmhmm 	
g	and then straight across until about a centimetre to the west of the pyramid 	
f	will we walk to the top of it 	
g	no 	
g	straight across until 	
f	right 	
g	on the same level 	
f	okey-dokey

f	yeah 	
g	right 	
g	do you have a cobbled street 	
f	no 	
g	right 	
g	below the pyramid there's a cobbled street and 	
f	directly below it 	
g	ehm it's below the western side of the pyramid 	
f	right so it'll be 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	now 	
g	from where you are just now draw a curved line 'til you're below the "d" of pyramid 	
f	right 	
g	and then straight across until you're just below the point of the pyramid at the western tip 	
f	right 	
g	right 	
g	go at an angle slightly more slightly to the west of south 	
f	right 	
g	to avoid the cobbled street there 	
g	and do you have a remote village 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and just to where the the thick lines at the remote village drawing are 	
f	yeah 	
g	just about a centimetre to the west of the l-- thick line and stop there 	
f	right 	
g	now 	
g	curve round draw a curve until you're below the "r" of remote 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and then 	
g	straight across until you're below the "e" 	
f	the "e" in remote 	
g	the "e" in village sorry 	
f	"e" in village 	
f	right 	
g	and then 	
g	go straight across another inch and that's the finish
