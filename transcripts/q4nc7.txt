f	oh right 	
f	have you got the rope bridge 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	right 	
f	where do i go across to 	
g	right you're just heading down to the left diagonally down to the bottom of the extinct volcano 'til you're about a centimetre left of the "e" in extinct volcano 	
f	ah 	
g	okay 	
g	see your "e" 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	right 	
g	go along about a centimetre and draw a dot 	
f	to the left 	
g	uh-huh to the left 	
f	above the "e" 	
g	no 	
f	oh right 	
g	b-- just d-- st-- across from the "e" 	
f	okay 	
g	okay 	
f	just a centimetre and draw a dot 	
g	just about a centimetre and a half 	
g	and draw from your start draw a line from your start down to that dot 	
f	down to it 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	diagonally down 	
f	not across to it 	
g	well it's kind of down 'cause your start's above the extinct volcano 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	okay 	
f	right 	
g	so you've drawn a line down to th-- there 	
f	to where 	
g	to that dot that i've just given you about a centimetre from the extinct volcano 	
f	right 	
f	oh right 	
g	okay 	
f	what to the left of the "e" 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	oh right okay 	
g	so you're going down that way and right keep on going down 'til you're about three centimetres from the bottom of the page 	
f	mmhmm 	
f	so i'm in a diagonal at the moment 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	you're to go down like diagonally 	
f	okay 	
f	and we're past we don't go through the old volcano no 	
g	no

f	okay 	
f	okay 	
f	okay 	
g	okay 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	right 	
g	diagonally go down towards the left about another two centimetres continue your line for about another two centimetres 	
f	okay 	
g	down 	
g	okay 	
f	so like 	
g	then st-- 	
f	okay 	
g	so you're getting towards the bottom of the page

f	uh-huh 	
g	right 	
g	y-- on my map i've got a tribal settlement along to the left towards the left-hand side of the page 	
f	no i haven't 	
g	and what you're going to do is draw a straight line to the left 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	until you're about three centimetres from the left-hand side of the page 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	okay so just draw a straight line 	
f	until you're about three centimetres 	
g	centimetres from the left-hand side of the page to your left okay 	
f	okay 	
g	then stop 	
f	right okay 	
g	right 	
g	see your rope bridge 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	you're now going to go up the page 	
g	towards your rope bridge and you're going to cross the rope bridge 	
f	mmhmm 	
f	okay 	
g	okay so go s-- 	
f	so do i go straight up then 	
g	uh-huh just go straight up

g	you know how you've the rope bridge 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	j-- just just go up as though you're going to 	
f	oh right 	
f	just doing a diagonal again towards it 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	just you're just going up towards your rope bridge 	
f	okay 	
g	and cross it 	
f	and cross it 	
g	and cross it 	
f	okay 	
g	okay 	
f	okay 	
g	right 	
g	now you're at the right-hand side of your rope bridge 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	now can you go diagonally down right for about two centimetres just like diagonally down right not straight down 	
f	oh right okay 	
g	but just diagonally down right 	
f	uh-huh 	
f	for two centimetres 	
g	for two centimetres 	
f	okay 	
g	and stop 	
f	okay 	
g	right 	
g	and then you're going to keep on going right but you're going to go straight for about six centimetres 	
g	have you got a collapsed shelter 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	right 	
g	just under the "o" of the collapsed shelter you're going straight right 	
f	oh right so oh right 	
g	until you're underneath the "o" of the collapsed shelter you're about th-- two centimetres below the "o" of the collapsed shelter actually 	
f	is there not a squiggly line there 	
f	'cause i've got a machete in between the rope bridge and the collapsed shelter i couldn't go straight across 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	that's why you're going down 	
f	oh right okay 	
g	see i've taken you down diagonally right and then now you're going straight across right 	
f	oh okay 	
g	see what i mean 	
f	oh no no 	
g	right you've just crossed the rope bridge 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	and instead of going straight across to the collapsed shelter 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	i'm taking you down right and then across 	
f	okay 	
g	okay i'm taking you down a wee bit down a wee "u" shape 	
f	is it not a couple of inches 	
g	aye it's a couple of inches across to the collapsed shelter 	
g	but you're only going down about a couple of er you're only going down about an inch 	
f	i'm going down more than that 	
g	well don't go d-- 	
g	just go down

f	uh-huh okay right 	
g	okay 	
f	okay 	
f	i'll draw in that 	
g	okay 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	right 	
g	now i want you to go right through the "o" of the collapsed shelter 	
f	right through it 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	well you know what i mean you know as though you're going up that way 	
f	uh-huh 	
f	okay 	
g	and i want you to go up there for about three inches

g	you've got the white mountain up above the saxon barn 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	well what we're going to do is we're going down and we're doing a "u" shape to miss these pelicans 	
f	okay 	
g	so what you're doing is you're 	
f	are they in a straight are they like horizontal to the saxon barn 	
g	are there they're horizontal to the saxon barn 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	but they're they're th-- they're they're they're down a bit they're in between the saxon barn and the rope bridge if you can think about it 	
f	okay 	
g	see to like to make a triangle see the point of the triangle 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	if you make a triangle from saxon barn to rope bridge at the point and that's where the pelicans are 	
g	see if you join the rope bridge and the saxon barn together 	
f	uh-huh 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	and then like you make a triangle out of it 	
f	right okay 	
g	that's where the pelicans are 	
f	okay right okay
