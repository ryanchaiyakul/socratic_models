f	just above the diamond mine 	
g	have you got 	
g	yeah 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	so you want to go just round the side of the diamond mine 	
f	right 	
g	so you're at the bottom of that 	
f	right 	
g	right now ehm 	
g	have you got a wagon wheel 	
f	um no 	
f	i've got a swamp

g	oh right 	
f	mm 	
g	i've i've not got any of that i've got 	
g	oh the swamp is that to the left of the diamond mine 	
f	uh-huh to the left of the diamond mine 	
g	sorry right i see 	
g	well 	
g	you want to go to the right of the diamond mine just keep going the same sort of direction you are 	
f	right 	
g	in a slight slight up gradient for about 	
f	right 	
g	ehm eh have you got the swan pond at the bottom 	
f	eh swamp's at the bottom left yeah 	
g	the s-- no the 	
f	and i've to go to the right

g	no sorry right at the bottom of the map there's a swan pond

f	there's a saloon bar at the bottom of my map 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	to to the right of that have you not got a swan pond no 	
f	no 	
g	well 	
g	just just go eh to your right from the bottom of the diamond mine 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	eh in a slight up gradient 'til you're just sort of past centre of the map 	
f	right 	
f	right 	
f	right okay 	
g	uh-huh ehm 	
g	better make sure you're f-- a f-- a reasonable bit to the right-hand side of the map actually 	
g	'cause there's a wh-- a wagon wheel here you've got to miss 	
f	right 	
g	right now y-- 	
g	ehm 	
g	you've got have you got a rift valley in the top right hand corner 	
f	yeah uh-huh uh-huh 	
g	and is that the only obstacle you've got 	
f	in just where i'm going there's a cactus as well 	
g	right well 	
g	you want to go up straight up and then along over the top of the rift valley and then down through the middle of it 	
f	right 	
f	so it's straight up to the rift valley 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	and then down through the middle of it 	
g	down through the middle of it yes 	
f	right 	
g	right 	
g	so you're you're at the middle of the rift valley 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	now 	
g	have you got rocks below that 	
f	yeah 	
f	quite a bit below 	
f	it uh-huh 	
g	uh-huh quite a bit below 	
g	it s-- now 	
g	you want to go down straight down to about halfway to the rocks and then just miss the rocks on the left-hand side 	
f	right 	
g	a sort of miss them by go a diagonal line straight down in a diagonal line 	
f	right okay 	
g	missing the rocks by a couple of centimetres 	
f	right 	
g	right eh you've 	
g	have you got a stone creek 	
f	eh no 	
g	no you've not 	
g	right 	
f	ehm there's like to the left of the rocks there's rapids and then like below the rocks there's an outlaws' hideout 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	well 	
g	straight across from the rocks on the left i've got the stone creek 	
g	so what you want to do is you want to keep going down the same direction you're going 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	and 'til you're about the middle of the paper 	
f	right 	
g	and you stop so you're in sort of in a line with the writing of rocks 	
f	right 	
f	so i need to go down as well yeah 	
g	you need to go down yeah 	
f	right got that 	
g	right 	
g	now you want to go 	
g	i've got white water you've you've got something else apparently 	
g	you want to go up slightly and 	
g	what have what have you got to the left of where we are 	
f	rapids 	
g	you've got rapids 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	ah right i've got white water so it's the same 	
f	yeah 	
g	sort of thing presumably 	
f	yeah 	
g	you want to go up the same sort of gradient to the left as you've been going down 	
g	if you know what i mean 	
f	oh right okay 	
g	so you're above 	
g	you're above the rapids 	
f	the rapids 	
f	uh-huh right 	
g	and then 	
g	c-- and then 	
g	come down the side of them at the side of them 	
f	right okay 	
g	right 	
f	right 	
g	so 	
g	have you got anything in the sort of vicinity round about here any obstacles 	
f	rapids well below the rapids there's a manned fort 	
g	well 	
g	you want to go ehm s-- straight down well curve out slightly from where you are and then curve back in eh straight down to 	
g	have you got the stone creek 	
f	yeah uh-huh 	
g	ehm sort of well ten centimetres above the stone creek in a line with just above the stone slabs that sort of level 	
f	right 	
f	right 	
g	and and above the stone creek you want to go down there in a sort of curved slight curved circle the sort of shape of an eye 	
f	right 	
g	i would say 	
f	down to about where just where the stone creek is yeah 	
g	above above the stone creek directly above the middle of that about where the just above the level of the stone slabs 	
g	have you got the stone slabs yeah right 	
f	right 	
f	yeah uh-huh right right 	
g	right 	
g	you there yeah 	
f	uh-huh yeah 	
g	right 	
g	have you got an outlaws' hideout to your right 	
f	yeah 	
f	that's quite a bit above though 	
g	quite a b-- yeah that's right 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	you want to go eh up up to that so you're just underneath the outlaws' hideout 	
f	right 	
f	right 	
g	now right 	
g	you're direct underneath the ou-- outlaws' hideout 	
g	you want to curve out to your right slightly so you're about two or three centimetres well five centimetres off the edge of the page 	
f	right 	
g	and then just go straight down 	
g	have you got the noose 	
f	yeah uh-huh 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	go go just go straight down from there so you're eh at the bottom of the noose on the right-hand side of it 	
f	right 	
g	just a straight line down 	
f	right 	
g	right now you want to curve down 	
g	have you got the swan pond 	
f	no 	
g	you've not got the swan pond 	
f	there's just a noose and then like to the left there's stone creek and below that there's a saloon bar but nothing else 	
g	aye right the saloon bar right 	
g	well 	
g	basically from the noose you're wanting to get to underneath the saloon bar 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	what you've got to do is y-- ehm drop from the the noose in a sort of curve to your left 	
f	right 	
g	so that you're just about the level at the top of the saloon bar 	
f	right 	
f	right 	
g	right now 	
g	just go along a a couple of centimetres not too much 	
f	right 	
g	and and curve curve up and then back down so you're ah 	
g	you've not got the swan pond of course see i've got a swan pond there you need to go up over and round 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	so you want to be going up 	
g	up the way slightly and then back down 	
f	right 	
f	so so should i be sh-- ehm to the left of the saloon bar yeah when i finish 	
g	i'm 	
g	ehm y-- yes 	
g	you go underneath the saloon bar and finish to the to the left of it yeah so from from here you want to go up in a curve and then back down so you're at the same level you were originally avoiding the swan pond that i've got 	
f	right 	
f	right 	
f	okay 	
g	right 	
g	from there you just want to go g-- eh curves you're underneath the saloon bar 	
f	right 	
g	and from underneath the saloon bar 	
g	ehm 	
g	well the finish is 	
g	ehm i was going to say where where the says finish but of course that's not particularly useful 	
g	ehm a couple of i'd say five centimetres above the saloon bar and just off a few centimetres off the side of the map on the left-hand side that's where the finish is 	
f	oh right ehm 	
f	i've come down to the left of the saloon bar and i'm like at the bottom of the saloon bar just now 	
g	y-- right 	
g	you're bottom of the saloon bar 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	right 	
g	you just want to curve up eh along past the saloon bar 	
f	right 	
g	and 	
g	ehm 	
g	it's it's about eh it's just a few centimetres out from the left-hand side of the page a few centimetres up from the saloon bar it's 	
f	oh right 	
f	no i'm going towards the right just now 	
g	oh you're going towards the right sorry 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	right 	
g	you just want you want to be you're at the bottom of the saloon bar 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	and you want to just head up head up to your left basically in in a diagonal past the saloon bar 	
f	oh right 	
f	right okay 	
f	hang on 	
f	right 	
g	right 	
g	and you should be sort of just a few centimetres from the side of the left-hand side of the page 	
f	right 	
g	is that right 	
f	yeah uh-huh 	
g	well 	
g	that's it
