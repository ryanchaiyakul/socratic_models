g	right 	
g	ehm the diamond mine the d-- the diamond mine is like just eh to the the the right of you there 	
f	right i've got the diamond mine 	
f	i've got the start and the diamond mine 	
g	right 	
g	now just go down beside the left-hand side of the diamond mine and eh just to below the words the first "d" there 	
f	right 	
g	then draw a line ehm a kind of go from there eh to just below the "s" of springboks 	
f	don't have springboks 	
g	you don't have spri-- that's right 	
g	ehm okay right 	
g	in that case just draw a horizontal line to just below the eh to the the left of the "h" of highest viewpoint 	
f	horizontal 	
g	yes horizontal right 	
f	hold on right 	
g	now we're going to go round eh highest viewpoint 	
g	okay 	
g	so eh 	
f	a curve or 	
g	it well we can do it in a well just go eh vertically up to the "h" 	
f	right 	
g	then make a curve round to the eh like a semicircle 	
g	right 	
f	okay 	
g	eh is there anything below there 	
f	there's the overgrown gully 	
g	right 	
g	and eh what about safari truck 	
f	yes i've got that 	
g	now where's the overgrown gully 	
f	it's between highest viewpoint and the safari truck 	
g	eh what the midway between them 	
f	yes 	
g	and eh to the left or right of highest viewpoint 	
f	it's beneath it 	
f	it's to the right-hand side 	
g	it's directly beneath it 	
g	to the right-hand side of safari truck 	
f	slightly to the right-hand side 	
g	right of this one right okay 	
f	right to the middle of highest viewpoint anyway 	
g	okay right 	
g	so go on the outsides eh towards the paper edge ehm down to safari truck in a a slight curve 	
f	right 	
g	and then eh draw a diagonal line ehm from there across the top of safari truck down to field station 	
f	that's on my map it's slightly above field station slightly above safari truck 	
g	what is above that f-- 	
f	above that's field station's on a level slightly above safari truck 	
g	right 	
g	well mine's eh on the same level 	
g	ehm it what what is there anything else that's in eh that's causing it to be up like that 	
f	well there's a banana tree direc-- directly below diamond mine 	
g	right 	
f	it's slightly below safari truck slightly below the level of safari truck 	
g	right okay 	
g	well eh wh-- you're just next to the eh that what was the object you've just drawn past 	
f	i've just drawn past the overgrown gully 	
f	i'm now at the top right-hand corner of safari truck 	
g	right 	
g	ehm well draw eh a kind of diagonal line and then turn it 	
f	up or down 	
g	eh from right to left eh downwards 	
g	eh underneath field station 	
f	right that's way over the la-- the far left-hand side of the page on my map 	
g	where is field station 	
f	field station's way over the far left 	
g	it's the far l-- uh 	
g	well there's two field stations on my map 	
f	there's not one on mine 	
g	right 	
g	so you've only got one there 	
f	yes 	
g	and none there in the centre right 	
g	ehm in that case you want to draw the diagonal line and then 	
g	where is banana tree 	
f	banana tree is directly below diamond mine and it's slightly above the centre of the page 	
g	right 	
g	so eh well draw this d-- diagonal line down and then change it to a curve at the top level of banana tree and curve it round banana tree ehm with the apex of the curve pointing to the top right-hand corner sorry left-hand corner 	
f	right what was that again sorry 	
g	right 	
f	this pen's running out i think 	
g	if you hold it eh vertically it'll come down 	
f	it's gone 	
f	ah right 	
g	is it okay now 	
f	yes 	
g	right ehm right i'll just do the the bit at the safari truck right 	
g	draw a diagonal line from where you were 	
g	right 	
f	right 	
g	eh to the same just below the s-- the level of s-- the word safari truck and ab-- abou-- between banana tree and safari truck 	
f	okay 	
f	okay 	
g	which is slightly above eh banana tree 	
f	right 	
g	right 	
g	then draw a curve over banana tree ehm and curving round on it 	
f	down the left-hand side 	
g	right 	
g	and ehm now do you have gold mine between eh banana tree and rock fall at the bottom there 	
f	no 	
g	right 	
g	in that case eh well gold mine on my map is halfway between rock fall and banana tree 	
f	okay 	
f	directly below 	
g	okay 	
g	it's directly below banana tree and directly above rock fall a-- 	
f	right 	
g	and it's eh in the at the mid point of the two of that line 	
f	okay 	
g	right 	
g	so ehm i want you to come down to two thirds of the way between eh rock fall and banana tree have 	
f	is that two thirds beneath banana tree or two thirds up 	
g	two t-- eh that's two third beneath banana tree 	
f	right 	
g	right ehm now there i want you to draw ehm a horizontal line to the left sorry to the right sorry eh to the right just eh so that you're on the other side of banana tree if you understand 	
f	right 	
g	then the rope bridge can you see that on your map 	
f	yes 	
f	that's slightly above it's between where i am and banana tree roughly about halfway between 	
g	between where you are and where 	
f	banana tree 	
g	right well 	
f	it's on a line roughly between that it's over to the right-hand side of the page 	
g	right 	
g	ehm are crocodiles the other side of the thing 	
f	yes 	
g	yeah 	
g	ehm and eh the crocodile's to the right of the rope bridge 	
f	yes 	
g	right 	
f	to the right and below 	
g	right and below right 	
g	ehm what i want you to do is 	
g	is there anything between the go-- eh between the where you are now and the rope bridge 	
f	no 	
g	right 	
g	i want you to draw a line up to the rope bridge 	
f	straight line 	
g	yes a straight line up to rope bridge so that you can cross the rope bridge the actual bridge drawing of the bridge right 	
f	right 	
g	now do you have giraffes at the bottom eh right-hand corner 	
f	yes 	
g	right 	
g	i want you to eh draw round the crocodile eh on the outside of the page down to giraffes 	
f	right 	
g	right i want you to go underneath the giraffes 	
g	and there's any other obstacles there 	
f	there's a disused warehouse at the bottom roughly about two a third of the way in from the right 	
g	right 	
g	right 	
g	is it eh bel-- is it above great lake and below g-- giraffes 	
f	no 	
f	it's to the right of great lake on a level with it 	
g	right 	
g	well in that case i want you to ehm eh curve slightly up to eh just go underneath the giraffes and eh to on a level with the the word giraffes and stop there 	
f	right 	
g	right now i want you to eh go round the warehouse eh and under the great lake 	
g	by round i mean over like over the eh the warehouse 	
f	okay 	
f	right 	
g	right and then under the great lake 	
g	is there any other obstacles there 	
f	no 	
g	and then come up between eh 	
g	now it's the great lake and eh rock fall halfway between them but over to the left-hand side of the page is the finish point 	
f	okay 	
g	right
