g	basically jump over the wall yeah 	
f	okay jumped 	
g	okay 	
g	now move right 	
f	right okay 	
g	and move along to about three quarters along the way of the paper 	
f	three quarters 	
f	uh 	
f	okay i'll go that side okay 	
g	now 	
g	on my map if you were to move straight up until slightly higher than halfway up the paper 	
f	mmhmm 	
f	here's a ruined monastery 	
g	there's a ruined monastery 	
f	okey-dokey 	
g	now 	
g	move around the ruined monastery to the left 	
f	to the left mmhmm 	
g	and then move 	
g	do you have any obstacles between the monastery and the lake 	
f	um not directly no 	
g	the lake is slightly lo-- the lake is lower down the lake is lower down than the monastery is 	
f	is it 	
g	it is on this one yeah 	
f	oh well my lake's in the top right-hand corner 	
g	oh i see 	
g	i have a west lake which is on the east actually but never mind

g	no no well 	
g	go back and move over the top 	
f	okay right okey-dokey 	
g	and then move left and upwards 'til you come to the stile 	
g	i'm not sure how that's going to aff-- affect your lake 	
f	what on a diagonal 	
g	well 	
g	you could move aro-- you could move around and down in a sort of circular if you like you don't have to move diagonally 	
f	well 	
f	it's the easiest way 	
g	yeah i suppose 	
f	shorter 	
g	i suppose 	
g	don't tire yourself out erm 	
g	now move 	
g	directly upwards until you're clear of the stile much the same way as you did with the gate 	
f	mmhmm 	
f	jumping over the fence 	
g	yeah 	
g	and then move 	
g	do you have any obstacles between the stile and the dead tree 	
g	do you have a dead tree 	
f	i have no 	
g	no r-- 	
f	i have a dut-- 	
g	in relation to the 	
f	dutch elm if that's any good 	
g	so where are you at the moment 	
f	i'm above the stile 	
g	above the stile that's fine 	
g	now 	
g	if level with the stile on the extreme right-hand side there's a dead tree 	
f	mmhmm 	
f	well 	
f	i've got a dutch elm 	
g	well 	
g	that's dead isn't it 	
f	not necessarily

g	fine okay you've got a tree 	
f	okay 	
f	yes 	
f	i've got a tree 	
g	now 	
g	i'll just have to relay the route on the map 	
g	okay 	
f	okay 	
g	move left from where you are at the moment so that you're above the stile but stop when you get past the stile 	
f	yeah 	
g	okay ehm 	
f	i'm above the stile now 	
g	you're above the stile 	
g	now move in a move right so that when you s-- so that you stop just after the stile finishes 	
g	ehm 	
g	you're bloody useless 	
f	i'm on the right of the stile anyway 	
g	are you 	
f	yeah 	
g	told you 	
g	why aren't you on the left of it 	
f	well 	
f	i didn't go to the left of it 	
g	well 	
g	you ought to have gone to the left of it 	
f	well 	
f	you didn't say 	
g	okay 	
g	i'm saying now 	
f	so 	
f	you want me to go to the left and then back to the right again 	
g	yeah 	
g	go to the left 	
f	right okay 	
g	okay 	
g	then move upwards and to the right 	
f	okay 	
g	and stop when the stile stops 	
f	okay 	
g	okay 	
f	i'm in exactly the same place as i was before when you going to t-- 	
g	yeah i know 	
g	but but at least you've gone round the stile 	
f	okay 	
g	and there might be a monster who inhabits the right-hand of the stile you don't know 	
f	oh 	
f	well 	
f	i've missed it now 	
g	now right 	
g	now move straight up until you're about three quarters 	
f	what about this dead tree 	
g	well 	
g	we're coming to that in a minute 	
f	okay right 	
g	so 	
g	move three quarters upwards in relation 	
f	three quarters of what upwards 	
g	to the entire map 	
f	well 	
f	i'm about three quarters upwards anyway 	
g	well 	
f	a bit further upwards 	
g	don't move very much then 	
f	have you got a popular tourist spot 	
g	a poplar 	
f	popular tourist spot 	
g	no 	
f	oh i have 	
f	shall i miss it out 	
g	well well 	
g	if the maps may not be the same presumably you're we're going to have to avoid these obstacles 	
f	mmhmm 	
f	have you got a great viewpoint 	
g	yeah 	
g	yeah 	
g	i've actually got two great viewpoints 	
f	oh i've only got one that's not fair 	
f	how far do i walk from where 	
g	you can have my map if you want two i'm i'm not very keen on great viewpoints 	
f	okay 	
f	so do i go near the great viewpoint or not very far 	
g	um ah 	
g	so the great viewpoint's in the way 	
f	well 	
f	it's about sort of four inches up 	
g	four inches up and slightly to the left 	
f	well 	
f	very very slightly 	
f	are we going to go to this tree afterwards 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	well 	
f	can i not go straight down because otherwise i'll have to go over the 	
g	where are you at the moment 	
f	above the stile 	
g	above the stile 	
g	on this map there's a a sort of a bump basically in in the route 	
f	bump like a like a hill 	
g	yeah 	
g	no no no 	
g	well like a hill except yeah i suppose 	
f	yeah okay so 	
g	what i mean by that is there's a bump in the route there isn't a bump on the map 	
f	okay 	
f	i'll go right 	
f	i've gone i've gone further up 	
g	right 	
g	now move right and down in a sort of circular sweep until you get to the dead tree 	
f	right 	
f	to the tree 	
f	yay 	
g	and then move around a-- and 	
f	what side of the tree do you want me to be on 	
g	oh on the right side of the tree i want you to finish up on the right side of the tree 	
f	right okay 	
g	then move up and left and up so that you're to the right of the great viewpoint when you finish 	
f	okay 	
g	assuming that your great viewpoint's in the same place as mine 	
f	oh i've got to be on the left hang on 	
g	ah 	
f	what 	
g	i have two great viewpoints 	
f	oh 	
g	okay tuba ehm 	
g	go back until you're right of the dead tree 	
f	right i'm by the tree 	
g	right 	
g	do you have a lake to the top 	
f	i've an east lake 	
g	to the top that's fine 	
g	now 	
g	below the east lake 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	there's a great viewpoint as well 	
f	well i've got a rocket laun-- launch pad 	
g	well 	
g	that probably 	
f	same thing 	
g	similar 	
g	yeah 	
g	fine 	
g	so if you can move 	
g	where is the rocket launch pad in relation to the lake 	
f	erm it's beneath the lake on the right side 	
g	beneath the lake on the right side 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	mm 	
g	how can it be beneath the lake and on the right 	
f	well 	
f	it's beneath the lake and a bit on the right edge of the lake rather than on the left edge of the lake 	
g	nope 	
g	oh i see 	
g	oh 	
f	is that not it 	
g	well 	
g	the great viewpoint that i have is below the lake and if there was a midline through the lake it would be probably s-- s-- very slightly to the left of the midline 	
f	oh oh okay well 	
f	if i just go up say about by the edge of the lake where it's 	
g	if you go upwards and stop below the bottom of the lake so that you're about two thirds along the length of the lake 	
f	mmhmm 	
f	right 	
f	okay 	
g	okay 	
f	right 	
g	now 	
g	if you move left and along the bottom of the lake until the lake finishes 	
f	yeah hang on i've done this wrong 	
g	no 	
g	yeah 	
f	right 	
f	i was underneath the tree 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	and i've done a very squiggly line 	
g	yeah 	
f	ehm 	
f	and i went up and along left and then up again 	
g	you went up 	
f	and a-- up and along and up 	
g	up along to the left and then up 	
f	uh-huh 	
f	and i'm about two thirds along the lake 	
g	along the lake 	
g	from the left of the lake two thirds along 	
f	and 	
f	no 	
f	two thirds along from the right 	
g	i see 	
g	no you want to be two thirds along from the left 	
f	okay 	
f	so after the rocket launch 	
g	yeah 	
f	okay 	
f	and then where do i go up to the lake and along left 	
g	now wh-- 	
g	where you are from where you are at the moment if you were 	
f	making a right pig's ear of this map 	
g	if you move 	
g	left and along the base of the lake 	
f	okay 	
f	okay all along right 	
g	until the lake finishes 	
f	well 	
f	the lake's quite long 	
g	yeah 	
f	right okay 	
g	now 	
g	you ought to be standing at the 	
f	mmhmm 	
f	do you want me to go down a bit 	
g	no 	
g	you ought to be standing 	
g	if the lake continued down if the edge of the lake wasn't curved 	
f	mm upwards 	
g	yeah 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	then you ought to be standing at the extreme left edge of the lake 	
f	yeah 	
g	you are 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	well 	
g	that's you finished 	
f	oh
