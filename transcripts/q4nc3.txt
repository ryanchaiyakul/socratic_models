g	know what a curve is 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	right and i'm going towards down towards the ravine

f	sorry i can't 	
g	right 	
f	right 	
g	just draw a straight line 	
f	oh right oh god a straight line 	
g	okay just draw a straight line 	
f	oh but it's kind of curvy 	
g	that'll be easy uh-huh 	
f	but i'm still up at i'm still up at the top of page

g	uh-huh 	
f	right i get what you mean now 	
f	at the top of the burnt 	
f	right okay right 	
g	mmhmm 	
g	and you s-- finish your curve at where's the start you know parallel ehm just parallel no no no no f-- just down from start 	
f	right okay okay i've got it i've got it i've got it 	
g	okay an-- 	
g	and it's like parallel to the ravine the bottom of it is like well not parallel but on the same line as the ravine 	
f	ah right 	
f	on the straight line i've go-- it's kind of like as though it's just dubbed directly above the "a" 	
g	what 	
f	sorry on you go 	
f	right i've drawn this line 	
g	right 	
g	is it is it stopping just down from start in a straight line from start 	
f	uh-huh 	
f	well it's kind of curvy 	
g	uh-huh good good 	
g	curvy to the right 	
f	i'm all right curvy to the right 	
g	right 	
g	and then you go across and stop 	
f	this is a-- by the way this is about like five centimetres down from the top of the page this about right 	
g	aye 	
g	yeah 	
f	aye right okay 	
g	it should stop at v-- you know doing the just in a straight line from the ravine 	
g	right 	
f	right i've got it 	
g	in a straight line to like a straight line across like 	
f	towards the pine grove 	
f	you got a pine grove 	
g	no uh-huh yeah yeah 	
g	no not across to there 	
g	vertical right a vertical line this is quite good vertical line and stop just where the "r" is in forest down from forest 	
g	do you know what i mean 	
f	oh wait a minute a vertical line 	
g	mmhmm 	
f	you mean i'm going down towards the ravine i'll be in the ravine 	
g	oh no no 	
g	a horizontal line 	
g	right a vertical a 	
g	horizontal line mmhmm 	
f	towards the right 	
f	and where do i stop 	
g	just down from where the "r" is 	
g	okay 	
f	from pine grove 	
g	mmhmm 	
f	right okay 	
g	right 	
g	and then and then 	
f	oh i'm not allowed to move 	
f	right 	
g	go up again ehm you know how you got the ravine just go up and past the ravine 	
g	have you got the remote village no 	
f	i'm a-- i'm really past the ravine by now 	
f	i'm at the pine grove i'm at at towards the right-hand side of the page 	
g	well go back don't pass the pi-- don't pass the ravine 	
f	oh the "r" of the ravine 	
g	pardon 	
f	i thought you meant the "r" of the pine grove 	
g	no 	
f	right wait a minu-- 	
g	don't pass the ravine okay 	
g	it's the "r" of the burnt forest i was talking about 	
f	oh so you this line was only about two centimetres long 	
g	uh-huh yeah 	
f	right 	
f	right 	
f	i'm not past the ravine 	
g	right okay 	
g	and go up 	
f	up

f	and i came and i did a d-- a kind of a curvy right just to like towards like 	
f	you see where it says burnt forest 	
g	mmhmm 	
f	just about parallel where it says burnt forest so i'm up there 	
f	do you know where i am 	
g	right 	
f	about five centimetres from the top of the page 	
g	do you want to start again 	
f	right 	
g	right start okay 	
f	right

f	oh just vertically down 	
g	uh-huh vertically down 	
g	okay 	
f	right 	
g	but missing out anything that might be in between 	
f	down towards 	
f	right 	
g	okay 	
f	can you do this

g	okay 	
f	right 	
f	i'm at diag-- 	
f	right i know what you mean now 	
f	right i'm at the ravine 	
f	and then i go along to where it says "r" of the ravine 	
g	no 	
g	you go along to where it says "r" of the burnt forest 	
f	oh right 	
g	a horizontal line 	
g	okay 	
f	right okay 	
g	just in line with the "r" of the burnt forest 	
f	oh right i've got you now right i've got that 	
g	and then you go up a vertical line 	
f	to the top of the ravine 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	right okay 	
f	and i've got the carpenter's cottage 	
f	so i have to miss that 	
g	yeah you'll have to miss that 	
f	so see the wee seagulls at the ravine 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	just about up there 	
g	above that yeah 	
f	oh i've got you now right 	
g	and then a horizontal line 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	under the remote village 	
g	have you got that 	
f	i've not got the remote village is it 	
g	well don't go very far just go a little bit above the seagulls in the ravine 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	okay 	
f	right 	
g	and then draw a horizontal line 	
f	just to about the end of the ravine 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	right 	
g	well a wee bit further 	
f	right 	
g	okay 	
f	have to just towards halfway between the pine grove no 	
f	you got the pine grove 	
g	no i ha-- oh yeah i have yeah 	
g	right uh-huh across to there 	
f	oh as far as that 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	it doesn't matter i'm just going to tell you to draw straight lines 	
f	okay 	
g	okay 	
g	and like you go right go in a vertical line down just until you you're underneath the pine grove 	
f	right okay 	
g	okay 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	and then 	
g	ehm 	
g	oh i can't get you 	
g	have you got anything

g	tell you what miss out 	
g	have you got i don't think you'll have the concealed hideout 	
f	i do 	
g	have you oh you do 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	oh well right just draw a line right draw a line until 	
g	what you've got to do is 	
g	i would suppose that your avalanche is ehm miss-- right your avalanche is like outwith the line 	
g	do you know what i mean 	
f	uh-huh yeah it is 	
g	so like the line is within well m-- in my map i think the line is within the avalanche 	
f	the avalanche is quite far to the right 	
g	okay right 	
g	what you do is w-- wh-- in my picture i've got two och how could you say bumps right i would say the avalanche is missed out it's drawn to miss out the avalanche 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	but includes within this line it includes the concealed hideout 	
f	right 	
g	so could you draw something that would 	
f	do you want me to go down towards the concealed hideout 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	missing out the avalanche 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	and goi-- and go round the concealed hideout concealed hideout 	
f	to your right 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	go round it and include it in the line 	
f	right i'm just drawing my line underneath the word concealed hideout now 	
g	oh good right 	
g	you d-- have you done that yeah d-- drawn it underneath 	
f	uh-huh 	
f	i've drawn my line 	
f	and it's just i'm just at the down below the "t" of concealed hideout 	
g	oh right okay 	
g	well draw a a horizontal line over 	
g	have you got the boat house 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	over to the boat house 	
g	right 	
f	you mean vertical down to the boat house 	
g	no

g	ehm uh-huh 	
g	right well go back up again to the concealed hideout 	
f	i'm at the concealed hideout 	
g	and you're you've drawn a horizontal line 	
f	i'm just 	
f	see where the boat house is 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	b-- the boat house at crane bay 	
g	i've got two 	
g	well 	
f	mm the one the one further down the page 	
g	uh-huh yeah

g	have you got another boat house 	
f	i've only got one boat house 	
g	oh right 	
g	well i've got two 	
g	i've got one parallel to the concealed hideout well just about 	
f	oh right 	
f	i've not 	
g	well what you could do is draw a line underneath the concealed hideout until you get 	
g	right see the "b" of crane bay 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	well until you stop at the "b" 	
f	oh right 	
f	i've gone along too far then 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	stop at the "b" 	
f	right okay 	
g	and then go right down horizontal i mean vertical go right down 	
g	you know how you've got that have you got the crane bay have you got the actual outline of it 	
f	to what 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	well go right down 	
f	until i touch the outline 	
g	no no no no no 	
g	until you're nearly touching it you're maybe just like half a mil-- half a centimetre
