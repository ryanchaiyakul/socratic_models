who	$m	
g	you done this one before 	
f	no 	
g	oh super 	
g	you'll have no chapel 	
g	okay "a" "q" "7" "c" "8" plus minus "4" "u" david 	
f	and mark 	
g	right 	
g	you've got the start point 	
f	yeah 	
g	up high on the left-hand side yeah 	
f	yeah 	
g	eh you got a haystack 	
f	just there 	
g	just below it 	
f	to the right to left 	
g	well 	
g	take a curve well 	
g	you know where the c-- er the carpenter's house is 	
f	yes 	
g	well take about a couple of inches well about an inch a couple of inches just just below the start of it do a curve which just about meets the haystack and eh goes to just eh directly below a level with jus-- just below level with the start eh the carpenter's house 	
f	so you go if i curve from the start round to 	
g	so you're doing it's like a 	
g	it's like 	
f	just along and 	
g	a backwards "c" 	
f	mm 	
g	just beside the haystack meets the haystack just about about half a centimetre from the haystack and comes out to below the start line just below the level of the carpenter's house 	
g	right 	
g	you've got 	
f	you got the 	
g	directly below the start 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	yeah 	
f	right 	
g	then you've got about half a centimetre below the carpenter's house 	
f	right 	
g	you've got that point do you want to mark a point there 	
f	right 	
f	there's 	
g	right 	
g	and you go from the start 	
f	so you've 	
g	so about you 	
f	carpenter house from 	
g	start and you do a curve about half a centimetre from the haystack down to the point 	
f	down to the point just at the side of the carpenter's house 	
g	yeah 	
f	so just curving round down it like that 	
g	just under the start 	
g	no 	
g	it's just under the start the point just under start and just under carpenter's house 	
f	oh 	
f	right 	
g	so you're it's it's going just it's eventually going to end up just below the start line but it's half a centimetre under the carpenter's house 	
f	half a centimetre under the carpenter's house right 	
g	so 	
f	so we're down below the carpenter's house about half a centimetre 	
g	on the level 	
g	yeah 	
g	but across below the start 	
g	see what i mean 	
f	oh away round here below the start 	
g	yeah 	
g	so it's that's the level you're going to 	
f	ah right 	
f	so it sort of curves round like that backwards "c" as you've said 	
g	it's not 	
g	it's just to the le-- it's to the left of the haystack it's just a really shallow thing 	
f	doesn't sound like what i've got 	
g	right 	
g	you sti-- 	
g	right 	
g	we'll start again then 	
g	you've got the start line right 	
f	this is a good one 	
g	and you've eh 	
g	well 	
g	you're going to end up directly below the start line 	
g	okay 	
f	mmhmm 	
f	so down below 	
g	down below start line 	
f	mm 	
g	now 	
g	you want to 	
g	the point below the start line is level with about half a centimetre below the carpenter's house 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	yeah 	
f	right okay 	
g	so you've got about half a centimetre below the carpenter's house draw a line across to below the start line 	
f	right 	
g	right 	
f	drawn that if 	
f	it's across 	
g	well don't draw a line draw a point there sorry 	
g	okay 	
g	and you want to 	
f	right 	
f	i've started 	
f	so from the start i'm going what direction 	
g	you're going down towards the haystack 	
f	down towards the haystack 	
g	and you're missing the l-- haystack on the left by about half a centimetre 	
f	on the left 	
f	on the left 	
g	on the left of the haystack yeah 	
f	so i'm coming down past the left 	
g	uh it's it's just a shallow 	
g	yeah 	
g	a shallow curve to that point down there 	
f	uh-huh right okay 	
g	right 	
g	you want to go about an an inch to the right towards the carpenter's house 	
f	an inch to the right right 	
g	and then you want to go up 	
f	up 	
g	yeah 	
g	you want eh green bay 	
g	have you got green bay no right at the top 	
f	green bay 	
g	no 	
f	no 	
g	well you want to go up 	
f	so you're going up p-- on the right-hand side of the hi-- haystack 	
g	yeah you're d-- well let me see i'll tell you in a minute 	
g	see the carpenter's house 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	you've got the left-hand side of the roof 	
f	right 	
g	well you've got about an inch from the top of that just less than an inch 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and you mark a point there 	
f	right 	
g	right 	
g	and join up the two points 	
f	so you've gone th-- start down to shallow curve round the haystack and along to that point 	
g	yeah 	
g	yeah 	
g	that's directly below the start 	
g	yeah 	
f	below the s-- directly below the start 	
g	mm 	
f	no 	
g	no 	
g	right 	
g	from the beginning again 	
g	right 	
f	i think you're murdered 	
g	you're going directly below the start but you're taking a curve that just misses the haystack 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	it's just a really really sh-- shallow curve 	
f	yeah 	
g	right you've got that 	
f	you're going so you're going d-- you're going down your star-- your starting point 	
g	you've got that in 	
g	you're going starting down 	
f	you just go down curve round the bottom of the haystack 	
g	and then you curve round the other way and you come to the bottom jus-- 	
f	and you you come to the the roof a point where the roof of the carpenter's house left-hand side 	
f	an inch above it 	
g	well 	
g	right 	
g	from the start you're starting directly below the start point is where you want to go that well make that the first move 	
g	you got that you got that it's shallow curve 	
f	right 	
f	shallow curve i've got 	
f	i go down just and curve round the haystack 	
g	well not round 	
g	you want to finish below the starting point you go down you curve past you curve past the haystack 	
f	so just a wee 	
g	it's like a an inverted "c" 	
f	so i'm curving back like 	
g	it's like a "c" the wrong way round 	
f	well i'm just curving back in 	
g	yeah 	
g	you're coming round to besi-- to below the start point which is also on a level below the carpenter's house that's to tell you where to stop 	
f	all right 	
f	so i'm actually i'm starting here and i'm finishing 	
g	directly below start 	
f	so it's just a wee shallow curve 	
g	aye 	
f	well i'll have to miss the blacksmith i've got a blacksmith's right okay that's 	
g	that's you 	
g	okay so you should just be about half a centimetre below the carpenter's house right 	
f	a lot of rubbing scribbling going on here 	
g	so you're half a centimetre below the carpenter's house you're on that level 	
f	right 	
f	mmhmm 	
f	right okay 	
g	so you come across an inch from that point 	
f	to the right 	
g	to the right 	
f	right 	
g	and that's about an inch from the carpenter's house as well 	
f	sec 	
g	yeah 	
f	yeah 	
f	a wee bit further 	
g	now 	
g	you've got that point in then yes 	
f	yeah 	
g	so you want to go up 	
g	you see the carpenter's house the roof the left-hand point of the roof 	
f	mmhmm 	
f	so i want to go up to 	
g	so you want to go up 	
g	there's an inch above there right just maybe a bit less than an inch 	
g	right 	
f	right so a-- 	
g	and you want to join that point those two points up and that's in a sort of thirty thirty degree angle or something like that 	
f	so it's a sort of diagonal 	
f	right okay i'll just 	
g	right 	
f	right 	
g	just take it across about one two two inches it's slightly below and eastern 	
g	right 	
f	so one easter and we're going 	
g	slightly below it two inches slightly below east it's about like ninety five degrees 	
f	yeah 	
g	right 	
f	right 	
g	and you've got the seven beeches 	
f	yeah 	
g	see you're about an inch above the seven beeches and about an inch to the left of the seven beeches that right 	
f	no i'm not an inch above them 	
f	to the carpent-- the carpenter's house an inch above the c-- top left corner is is on a level with that the top of the seven beeches so now i've gone down 	
g	not an inch above them 	
g	well you want to be about call it half an inch above the seven beeches 	
f	right so i'll just 	
g	right 	
f	right okay 	
g	and from that point there you want to go about it's just off south to below the "s" in seven beeches 	
f	just off south 	
g	it's southeast you want to be going right just below the "s" 	
f	southeast mmhmm 	
f	right down that way just below the "s" wait a minute 	
g	right 	
f	just below the "s" 	
g	now eh 	
g	you've got reclaimed fields down below that 	
f	yeah i have 	
g	down below 	
g	well 	
g	in between the seven beeches and the reclaimed fields i've got a chapel 	
g	okay 	
f	mm right 	
f	i don't have that 	
g	so 	
g	eh what i need to do is i need to go round it again an inverted "c" well it's no an inverted "c" it's li-- the other way about opposite "c" 	
f	right 	
g	and you need to go around it so eh 	
f	so i sort of curve underneath seven beeches and round and then over to back to where i started from 	
g	yeah so you 	
g	the the actual point where you want to finish up is eh 	
g	you see the the thick tree trunk on the right-hand side of the seven beeches 	
f	mmhmm 	
f	the the the furthest right one 	
g	so you want to finish 	
g	yeah 	
g	you want to finish about two inches below that 	
f	right 	
f	hold on to 	
g	which is about h-- about a centimetre above the reclaimed fields 	
g	does that make sense to you 	
f	mm 	
f	no 	
f	the reclaimed fields are quite a distance away 	
g	miles below it yeah 	
f	aye 	
g	well eh 	
g	we'll call it just about two inches maybe a bit more call it two and a half inches below the tree trunk 	
g	right 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and that's where you e-- want to finish up 	
f	right 	
g	so to do that you'll need to take from the "s" and go round like from twelve o'clock to three o'clock 	
f	yeah around 	
g	and go out an inch 	
f	and then 	
f	and then back in again 	
g	from the "s" 	
g	and then back into that point i told you 	
f	yeah 	
g	right 	
f	got that 	
g	s-- now 	
g	you want to go like the end of a test tube like that way you want to go round the reclaimed fields like that 	
g	have you got crane bay 	
f	crane bay yeah 	
g	you see the m-- the most northerly tip above the "b" 	
f	over the right yeah 	
g	well 	
g	you want to come round the test round the reclaimed fields and the test tube sh-- sort of shape to about oh i don't know about an inch and a half above the "b" 	
f	an inch 	
f	above the "b" 	
g	above the "b" yeah 	
g	well 	
f	so the point right 	
g	no 	
g	above the point sorry 	
g	above the tip 	
f	have you got whitewashed cottage 	
g	no 	
f	no 	
f	so i'll have to miss that 	
f	so 	
f	if i come round in my curve and then i'm going along and then curving back round the same way 	
g	yeah 	
g	so the shape will be you'll be going east and then you'll be going down 	
f	a kind of inverted in a "s" a backwards "s" 	
g	it's not 	
g	well prob-- 	
f	sort of 	
g	it's just like that shape you want to do so you're going east and then you're going that curve and then you're going west until you're above that 	
g	tip 	
f	ah well 	
f	the whole thing in together like from the seven beeches round it's like an "c" and then and it's like a normal "c" sort of 	
f	right i'll try and an inch and a half above there i'll have to draw it a bit s-- squint 	
f	so i'm so i'm coming down on the right-hand the left-hand side of the reclaimed fields 	
g	yeah 	
f	and i've sort of s-- curved round to about there 	
g	so you've got you've gone round the reclaimed fields 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and you're about an inch and a half above the tip the northern-most tip 	
f	yeah about an inch 	
g	now 	
g	you want to go south down to that northern-most tip 	
f	right 	
g	right 	
g	just off to the left-hand side of it 	
g	okay 	
f	right 	
g	and you want to follow the contours of the bay round to the first 	
g	well you know how it it sort of goes down in a curve 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	and then you get a southern a dead south it goes almost due south 	
f	yeah 	
g	well you want to follow the contours round to that point 	
f	just skirt it along 	
f	right 	
f	i'm just ready to go south 	
g	right 	
g	so now 	
g	have you got vast meadow and attractive cliff really close 	
f	no 	
f	i've got attractive cliffs which are round 	
g	right 	
g	well you want to go 	
g	see where it goes di-- due south 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	and then it almost goes due west 	
f	yeah 	
g	well you want to do a straight line about a centimetre you want yeah you've got that point come down the due south and come across the west 	
f	so skirting skirting along 	
g	yeah 	
g	no eh 	
f	just straight line 	
g	just a cen-- you want to do a centimetre above d-- the western-most tip right and draw a straight line from where you've stopped now 	
g	you know when y-- 	
f	uh-huh so it's right 	
f	so it's just like a straight line from the south that bit there where it goes due south to about a centimetre above 	
g	that's right 	
f	right 	
g	so it's about that sort of angle 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	now 	
g	you want to go due west until you're above the "a" in attractive cliffs 	
f	right 	
g	and then take it down about about the same angle as you took from the south to the west tip 	
g	take that down to the bottom just on the same level as attractive cliffs so you're doing down that angle and it's about an inch long shall we say 	
f	right 	
f	right 	
g	right you got that 	
g	now 	
g	in here you've got something to miss out haven't you 	
f	crashed spaceship 	
g	crashed spaceship 	
g	so you want to go west of the crashed space the crashed spaceship 	
f	right over to its west 	
g	you want over to its west 	
f	almost to the edge of the paper 	
g	yeah down the edge of the paper 	
f	right 	
f	just just past it 	
g	to just 	
g	to the level of a chestnut tree 	
f	yeah 	
g	when you get to chestnut tree curve round and go to about half an inch from the bottom of the chestnut tree 	
f	top 	
f	half an inch from the bottom 	
g	right 	
f	so i curve round oh so i'm on its left-hand side and i'm out about half an inch bef-- bottom 	
g	yeah 	
g	you go up about half the trunk of the chestnut tree to the dimple in the chestnut tree 	
g	you see the dimple in the chestnut tree 	
f	the dimple uh 	
g	halfway up the trunk just before the 	
f	aye 	
g	the branches start 	
f	the branches 	
f	right okay 	
g	you've got that's only about like a centimetre long 	
f	so 	
g	and that's your finish point 	
f	mmhmm 	
f	so i've taken my cur-- i've gone down past spaceship i've curved round to a point 	
g	about half an inch 	
f	above 	
g	no 	
g	you're you're half an inch from the base of the tree 	
f	yeah 	
g	and you s-- then you go due north 	
f	oh right 	
f	i've go to the bo-- i go to the base of the tree 	
g	from there you c-- half an inch from the base of the tree and then you go north half a way up the the tree trunk 	
f	curve around 	
g	all the way up the tree trunk basically to the stop at the 	
f	right 	
f	right 	
f	and that's it there 	
g	and that's your finish 	
g	so your the finish point should be level with where the branches start 	
f	uh-huh right 	
g	that right 	
g	i think we got that wee bit in a bit sh-- stramash 	
f	i know aye start
