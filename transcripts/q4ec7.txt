who	$m	
g	start top of the extinct volcano 	
g	it's the bottom right-hand corner of the map 	
f	oh 	
g	but it's marked well 	
f	okay 	
f	i was looking at the top 	
g	have you found it 	
f	yeah it's okay 	
g	right and if you move maybe one and a half centimetres from the top of there to the left 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and stop 	
f	is that horizontally 	
g	horizontally yeah sorry 	
f	okay 	
g	and then go down vertically about maybe five centimetres so you're actually below the extinct volcano you go down the left-hand side of it 	
f	pen's not working there that's done it okay 	
g	and stop about you're there 	
g	then you go horizontally left 	
g	have you got a tribal settlement 	
f	no 	
g	that's in the bottom left-hand corner of the map 	
f	mm 	
g	it's just a bit below the extinct volcano but sort just about the same level but the opposite side 	
g	so you go from that point where you stopped 	
f	okay 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	along to the left-hand corner of the map to about one and a half centimetres from the edge 	
f	just in a horizontal line 	
g	horizontal line straight across 	
f	okay do i have to do anything to avoid the the settlement 	
g	well if you if you go if you're just below the extinct volcano just now a bit below it 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	you can go straight along and you'll be underneath the tribal settlement 	
f	okay 	
f	how far away from the edge of the paper 	
g	one and a half centimetres 	
f	okay 	
g	stop 	
f	just get my ruler out 	
g	have you got a rope bridge 	
f	yeah 	
g	if you go straight up the left-hand side of where the tribal settlement would be 'til you're ehm just maybe below the rope bridge but like in a straight line so you're not absolutely underneath it but you're to the left-hand side of it because it curves round over onto the rope bridge 	
g	you know what i mean 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	so 	
f	okay 	
f	so i i go upwards like the same distance away from the paper 	
g	upwards for about 	
f	the edge of the paper until i'm just across from the rope bridge 	
g	yeah 	
g	un-- 	
g	no 	
g	'til you've f-- maybe one centimetre below it and then you sort of curve round 	
f	below the writing of rope bridge 	
g	no 	
f	below 	
g	below 	
g	do you ha-- the left-hand side of the rope bridge 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	but you don't go a straight line and then turn you curve round onto the rope bridge 	
f	okay 	
f	so i'm going to cross the rope bridge yeah 	
g	yes you cro-- 	
f	okay 	
g	are you crossing the rope bridge 	
f	you want me to cross it uh-huh 	
g	well if you curve round slightly and cross the rope bridge 	
f	okay 	
g	and then stop when you get to the other side 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	because you've got to curve down ehm it's not a wide cur-- curve it's quite a narrow curve down two centimetres 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	so 	
f	do you have a machete 	
g	instead 	
g	no i don't 	
g	where's the machete 	
f	it's to the right and just down 	
g	from the rope bridge 	
f	it's to it's about three centimetres to the right and just down from the rope bridge 	
f	so if i if i curve down and and go underneath where that is is that okay 	
g	is that curving down a lot 	
g	'cause it's only about one and a half centimetres two centimetres you've got to curve down 	
f	mmhmm 	
f	well where would i go once i curve down on your map 	
g	you turn right and go straight across so you're th-- you're about three centimetres above the start position 	
f	okay that's fine 	
f	i'll just go underneath it then 	
g	and stop when you're you're 	
g	have you got a collapsed shelter 	
f	uh-huh 	
f	just above there 	
g	yeah 	
f	so i should be like just underneath the collapsed shelter uh-huh 	
g	about two centimetr-- me-- --metres underneath it 	
f	that's fine 	
g	have you got a saxon barn 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	well you go straight up from that point where you were 	
f	mm 	
g	past the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter 	
g	just go straight up until you're on level with the top of the saxon barn 	
f	mmhmm 	
f	so just so just in a diagonal upwards from right to left 	
g	and stop there 	
g	no 	
g	straight line up to s-- the left-hand side of collapsed shelter so you're on the level with the top of saxon barn but not actually near it you're still on the right-hand side of the map 	
f	so it's a it is a diagonal upwards towards the 	
g	no 	
g	straight line upwards 	
f	well i can't do that 	
g	why not 	
f	'cause my saxon barn's on the 	
g	no you go straight up the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	you're not going over towards the saxon barn yet you're going to be on the same level with it 	
f	oh okay 	
f	have you got a crevasse 	
g	no 	
f	well have you got anything to the right of the saxon barn 	
g	no 	
g	so if you go straight up would you c-- curve round the crevasse to get to the saxon barn 	
f	if i went a bit to the right i could just go straight up 	
f	would that be okay 	
g	if you go well i was going 	
f	so i'd be on like a horizontal line with the saxon barn yeah 	
g	but the the top of it 	
f	okay 	
g	just a bit above 	
g	and you go straight up and curve round and then down and underneath the saxon barn 	
f	say that again 	
f	i'm on just now i'm on a horizontal line just beside above the saxon barn 	
g	but not right over it 	
f	no 	
f	i'm not beside it yet 	
g	no right 	
g	ehm so you would 	
g	ehm is where's the crevasse from there is it underneath you 	
f	it's just beside me just now it's just to my right like if i if i went sorry if i went to my left i would pass the crevasse and i would pass the saxon barn 	
g	right 	
g	so if you go over the top of the crevasse and down the side of it then underneath the saxon barn 	
g	could you do that 	
f	you want me to draw underneath the saxon barn 	
g	yes 	
f	uh-huh okay 	
f	where will i stop 	
g	and stop ehm beside the "s" 	
f	of saxon 	
g	saxon 	
f	okay 	
g	and have you got pelicans 	
f	no 	
g	no 	
g	ehm go down about three to four centimetres from the saxon barn vertically downwards 	
f	so i'm above the rope bridge 	
g	just a bit above the rope bridge yeah 	
f	okay 	
g	the end of it 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	and then go underneath where i've got pelicans towards the left-hand side 	
f	mmhmm 	
f	is that just beside the edge of the paper uh-huh 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	about a centimetre away from it 	
f	okay 	
g	stop 	
g	have you got a white mountain 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	go straight up from there ehm slightly curving a bit round the white mountain 	
f	over the top of it uh-huh 	
g	no 	
g	don't go over it g-- stop when you're parallel to the top of the white mountain 	
f	okay mmhmm 	
g	and have you got a golden beach at the top left-hand corner 	
f	yeah 	
g	go up to go straight up from the top of the white mountain to the edge of the golden beach

f	okay 	
f	so you want me to go above secret valley 	
g	nowhere ne-- 	
g	nowhere near secret valley 	
f	what 	
g	have you have you your golden beach is it at the top left-hand corner or the right-hand corner 	
f	top right-hand corner 	
g	oh well 	
g	there's one at the top left-hand corner of this map as well 	
f	oh okay 	
g	so you're at the top of the white mountain just now 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	go straight up five or six centimetres and stop 	
f	right i'm meant to be right on top of white mountain just well just beside the top yeah 	
g	well yes parallel to it uh-huh 	
f	so okay 	
g	straight up 	
g	stop 	
g	have you got slate mountain 	
f	yeah 	
g	go directly along from that point to the end of slate mountain 	
f	to the right-hand end of the slate mountain 	
g	uh-huh left-hand end of slate slate mountain 'cause you go over the top of it 	
f	okay 	
g	so just do that then go rou-- 	
f	whe-- where's the golden beach i've got to avoid is that like above 	
g	that's in the top left-hand corner yeah 	
f	okay okay 	
f	right 	
g	kind of are you over the mountain 	
f	you want me to go over it 	
g	just go over it and stop at the other side and curve right round underneath it so that you're about a centimetre underneath the "s" 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and you got a secret valley 	
f	yeah 	
g	can you go d-- v-- down from there down the left-hand side of the secret valley 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and are you underneath the secret valley 	
f	hold on you want me to be underneath the secret valley 	
g	go draw a straight line to the end of just about a centimetre away from the "y" and that's the finish 	
f	underneath it 	
g	underneath the "y" of secret valley 	
f	a centimetre down from the "y" yeah 	
g	mmhmm 	
f	okay 	
g	that's it
