f	so 	
f	and that's at an angle of forty-five degrees 	
g	no 	
f	right i see right

f	i've just come down a couple of inches 	
g	you've come down about one and a half inches 	
f	uh-huh 	
g	right so 	
g	if you do it then do a forty-five degree line for maybe about three inches 'til you're probably in line with the top of the walled city 	
f	erm 	
g	that height what you're you've to come down the middle of the page take the forty-five degree line down to the middle of the page 	
g	right 	
f	so i should be around the middle of the page 	
g	no not the mi-- the centre no not 	
f	see where i am just now right 	
f	i've come i've come round the top of the fast running creek
