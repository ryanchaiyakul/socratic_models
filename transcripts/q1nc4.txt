g	okay 	
g	once you're at the bottom of the pine forest just where it says pine

f	i 	
f	don't understand 	
f	say that again 	
g	oh two or three inches down from the pine forest 	
g	okay you know 	
g	it doesn't have to be an arc as long as you avoid all the obstacles i think eh if you you know if you finish up eh in line with the wheatfields 	
g	okay 	
g	but beneath the pine forest you if you stop drawing your line there 	
g	above the bakery in other words ab-- above the eh th-- th-- th-- 	
f	whe-- 	
f	where is your wheatfields 	
g	well er you know

f	okay 	
g	just just go down the left-hand side of the pine forest 	
f	right
