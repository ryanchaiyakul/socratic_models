who	$m	
g	right eh from start position you move down past the camera shop to the bottom left corner 	
f	right right 	
f	the camera shop's ri-- directly below the start position right 	
g	yes 	
g	you move down to l-- past the left-hand side of the camera shop 	
f	no right 	
g	and have you got parked van marked there beneath the camera shop 	
f	no 	
f	no-- it's just allotments to the eh right 	
g	no 	
f	and slightly below 	
g	you move 	
g	well approximately three inches below the camera shop you make an arc and then move up up and around the left-hand side of the allotments 	
f	and where do i stop 	
g	stop just at the bot-- the top right corner of the allotments just above that little shed 	
f	right 	
f	right 	
g	then you move in an angle slo-- sloping slightly upwards to approximately a third of the way across the page from the right and stop 	
f	so what is this eh there's a flight museum here on the 	
g	it's not marked on my map 	
f	oh right 	
f	ehm it's eh on the same level as the start position basically 	
g	slightly below approximately on level with the top of the camera shop 	
f	right 	
f	so you make an angle and that's a straight line 	
g	a straight line yes 	
f	right 	
f	from there to just above the camera shop 	
g	yeah 	
g	approximately two thirds away t-- from the right-hand side of the page 	
f	uh from the right-hand side of the page 	
g	no sorry 	
g	one third away from the right-hand side of the page 	
f	right 	
f	that's just below the flight museum 	
f	okay 	
g	well pu-- 	
g	have you got yacht club marked bottom right corner 	
f	yes uh-huh 	
g	well it's just slightly to the left of the yacht club on a level with the camera shop roof 	
f	okay 	
f	and where do we go after that 	
g	you turn straight up the page and make a straight line which curves over and around top of the disused monastery 	
g	have you got that mark 	
f	what on top of the monastery 	
g	above the monastery 	
f	and t-- uh right okay that's okay 	
g	to the left up the to the right and then curves over to the left 	
f	right 	
f	so we're going from like above the allotments to just above the yacht club no just above but ehm about 	
g	approximately three inches 	
f	same level as the camera shop basically 	
g	three four inches 	
g	yeah 	
f	and then eh from there going to disused monastery 	
g	yes 	
f	right 	
g	curving around the top of the disused monastery 	
f	yeah right 	
f	right 	
f	so curve around the disused monastery then where 	
g	and stop on the level with the base of it then the curve reverses itself and goes approximately li-- like it was before and then goes vertically up the side of the gr-- the alpine garden 	
f	right 	
f	could you just say that again 	
g	right from the disused monastery the left-hand side of disused monastery the curve makes a dip rather than a rise a trough 	
f	right 	
g	and stops level with the left-hand side of the alpine garden 	
f	right 	
f	so it's a a curve eh pointing upwards to get to the disused monastery 	
g	no 	
g	a curve poin-- going down the way uh 	
f	that's what i mean 	
f	i mean eh the apex of the curve is higher than the two base points basically 	
g	yes 	
f	right 	
f	and then a the reverse of the concavity of the thing to come round to the alpine garden 	
g	yeah 	
g	you stop on a level with the m-- disused monastery to slightly to the left of the alpine garden 	
f	right 	
f	right 	
g	then you go up vertically 'til just above the alpine garden 	
g	then you mak-- go right to the end of the alpine garden 	
g	then vertically again to the top of the youth hostel 	
f	there is no youth hostel 	
g	then about three inches 	
f	where was the youth hostel 	
g	youth hostel was t-- upwards and to the right of the alpine garden if you go up from four inches from where you stopped at the alpine garden vertically 	
f	right 	
f	right i think i know where it is 	
f	right ehm where where would i be going after that 	
g	after where 	
f	after the this youth hostel 	
g	after youth hostel 	
g	you'd be going an inch to your right and then a diagonal line sloping at approximately eh what'd it be now hundred and thirty five degrees from vertical 	
f	right 	
f	eh can you give me a name of an object i'll be going to 	
g	the telephone box 	
f	right okay uh right 	
f	so i go up just below th-- just to below the parked van 	
f	have you got a parked van 	
g	no 	
g	you go to about t-- two inches below the parked van 	
f	right 	
f	right 	
f	and then from there 	
g	you go 	
f	so it's 	
g	two inches right from that and then a straight line diagonally 'til underneath the telephone box 	
f	right 	
f	all right 	
f	underneath the telephone telephone box 	
g	yes 	
f	right 	
g	not directly underneath it 	
f	ehm 	
g	you're going to draw a s-- you're going to have to draw a straight line adding on to that that passes underneath the telephone box 	
f	right right okay 	
f	okay 	
g	then there's a straight line going under the telephone box 	
f	right 	
g	and a vertical line going up the right-hand side of the telephone box 	
f	and where does it go to 	
g	it stops about level with the top of the telephone box 	
g	then there's a sort of exponential curve that goes up to your right from that point and it starts to become vertical to the left of the telephone box on a l-- line left of the telephone box 	
f	and where's it going to is it going to the level crossing 	
g	it's going 	
g	not marked on my map 	
g	it's going to the right to the left of the thatched mud hut and 	
f	i don't have a thatched mud hut 	
g	no 	
f	whe-- have you got an east lake 	
g	yes 	
g	it stops approximately th-- on a line through the middle of the east lake 	
f	mm right 	
f	ehm well i've got a level crossing just below the the the ehm east lake 	
g	it'll probably mean go through that then 	
f	through the level crossing 	
f	ehm aren't we meant to eh avoid obstacles 	
g	avoid them 	
f	yeah 	
g	right ehm 	
f	i need to go ehm where where is it going is it going to eh eh parked van or some place 	
g	ehm no 	
f	eh where 	
g	it's going to the right of the parked van underneath the lef-- the very left-hand point of the east lake 	
f	right 	
f	so it's between ehm 	
g	it's on a level with the picket fence 	
g	have you got that top left corner 	
f	yeah i've got that 	
g	the finish point is on a level with that underneath the most left point of the east lake 	
f	right 	
f	r-- i'll go round it the level crossing 	
f	okay 	
g	right 	
f	is it a straight line or a curve 	
g	it curves 	
g	eh if the telephone box is there it curves up and then goes like that 	
f	right 	
g	from that's from seen from my point of view 	
f	and that's from the right-hand side of the telephone box 	
g	from the right-hand side of the telephone box it goes to the left-hand point 	
f	right 	
f	well i can't do an exponential so 	
g	that's the path marked there 	
f	i'll see what i can do 	
f	right 	
g	that you at the finish point 	
f	i'm just at the eh left-hand bottom corner of the east lake 	
g	the left-hand bot-- corner 	
g	you go just about an inch to your left 	
f	right 	
g	and that's the finish point 	
g	on a level with the picket fence 	
f	right 	
f	on a level with the picket fence
