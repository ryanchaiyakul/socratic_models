who	$m	
g	starting at the beginning head due south 	
g	you'll see a diamond mine on your map 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	avoid the diamond mine 	
f	due south 	
g	going due south followed by east 	
f	to the left of the diamond mine 	
f	to the west 	
g	east the right 	
f	so you want me to go east then south 	
g	no 	
g	south then east 	
g	we may have a different map 	
f	uh-huh right 	
g	can you head due south 	
f	sorry 	
g	can you head due south 	
f	i can head due south 	
f	am i meant i'm meant to draw this on aren't i right 	
g	and can you then head to the right past the diamond mine 	
f	yes 	
g	go for it 	
f	how far 	
g	you'll see a graveyard 	
g	do you see a graveyard on your map to the right of the diamond mine 	
f	no 	
g	right 	
g	they've obviously not marked the graveyard 	
f	how far to the right of diamond mine is it 	
g	the graveyard is almost halfway in between 	
g	do you have carved stones 	
f	i have carved stones at the top followed by a ravine followed by an indian country 	
g	right 	
g	in between the diamond mine and the carved stones is the graveyard that's where it should be 	
f	right 	
g	so what you need to do is continue past the diamond mine then past where you think the graveyard is 	
f	and then stop 	
f	past where it is 	
g	yeah 	
g	go rou-- same under under the graveyard south of the graveyard 	
f	is the graveyard due east of the diamond mine 	
g	the graveyard's 	
g	correct 	
f	so i really shouldn't hit it then if i'm south of the diamond mine 	
g	correct 	
f	right okay 	
g	s-- you then come no-- up north just to the left to the west of the carved stones 	
f	okay 	
g	so if you're almost on top of carved stones then you'll totally miss the graveyard 	
f	okay 	
f	right so i am now just directly north of the carved stones and slightly north of the start 	
g	that's correct 	
g	so you move east around carved stones 	
f	the carved stones 	
g	and then do you have gallows on your map 	
f	yes 	
f	but they're absolutely miles away 	
g	that's correct that's correct 	
g	all you need to do is go due south from the carved stones as far as you can see the gallows the same level as the gallows 	
f	past 	
f	right 	
g	you should be on top of the indian country correct 	
f	um and just south of the ravine 	
g	that's right 	
g	do you have a great rock 	
f	i have a great rock 	
g	it's to the west of indian country 	
f	no 	
f	it's very very southwest of indian country 	
g	right 	
g	that's a different great rock 	
g	okay what you have to do is 	
g	now that you're paral-- parallel with the gallows right 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	you're on a level with the gallows 	
f	i'm on a level 	
g	head southwest that's to the left and down past indian country 	
f	move west followed by south down to 	
g	no 	
g	s-- straight southwest 	
f	okay 	
g	not too far 	
f	right 	
f	i'm just below indian country 	
g	do you see the gold mine 	
g	do you see the gold mine 	
f	which is due we-- due west 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	yeah 	
g	i want you to go 	
g	west making sure that you remain above the gold mine 	
g	understand 	
g	so you go due west above the gold mine 	
f	okay 	
g	but n-- not too far north 'cause otherwise you'll hit the rock so i want you to head just above the gold mine 	
f	right 	
g	are you above the gold mine now 	
f	i'm 	
g	just to the west of it 	
f	just i'm just to the east of it 	
f	do you want me to go f-- slightly further 	
g	yeah 	
g	i want you to go just past it 	
f	right 	
g	so you're basically in the gap between the gallows and the gold mine 	
f	and the gold mine right 	
g	and i want you to go due sou-- 	
g	do you have a trout farm 	
f	yes 	
f	but 	
g	right 	
f	it's 	
f	that is coming due south followed by due east just above the totem pole just above the totem pole if you had the totem pole 	
g	that's correct i think 	
g	want you to head due south as far south as the trout farm just below the trout farm 	
f	just above the trout farm 	
g	b-- just below the trout farm 	
f	right 	
f	i'm i think i'm just below the trout farm 	
g	and head east 	
f	east 	
f	and land just below the trout farm 	
g	ah do you have any other obstacles 	
f	none 	
g	in the way 	
g	well head due east just below the trout farm trying to avoid any obstacles on your way 	
f	okay 	
f	i'm just below it directly below it i'm not east or west of it 	
g	right 	
g	now i've got a cavalry stockade on this map 	
f	a cavalry a cattle stockade 	
g	no 	
g	cavalry it's a fort thing 	
f	right 	
g	so we need to avoid that 	
f	well we don't 	
g	which means 	
f	is it directly south 	
g	it's almost south of the sou-- the trout farm it's south and slightly to the east 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	so i want you to go right past the trout farm almost to the edge of the map to make sure we miss it 	
f	okay 	
g	so you're past your totem pole there as well you're 	
f	my totem pole is directly below my gold mine 	
g	that's all right 	
g	right 	
g	i want you to go due south now 	
f	how far 	
g	ehm do you have a cattle stockade 	
f	i do 	
f	just above it 	
g	right 	
g	just below it you want to go round the bottom of it 	
f	do you want me to go to the bottom of the page 	
g	uh-huh that's correct 	
f	right 	
g	i want you to go west below the stockade 	
f	and below the parched river bed which i don't know if you have 	
g	although oh i don't have a river bed so 	
f	do you have a bandit t-- 	
g	is your river bed 	
g	whereabouts is level becau-- 	
f	do you have a bandit territory 	
g	uh-huh 	
f	directly bas-- directly we-- west of your cattle stockade 	
g	correct 	
f	that's in the middle of the two 	
g	right 	
g	my map deviates here so i presume that's why you must have an obstacle 	
g	so what i want you to do is go west as far left as the sta-- s-- just the edge of the "c" of the s-- cattle stockade 	
f	m-- 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	then do you have to go up to avoid the 	
f	well if there's a very very thin line i ca-- i can go up though yes 	
g	because that's how this map indicates 	
g	so i want you to go up not straight up ehm northwest 	
f	i can go north then west 	
g	up up in a curve 	
g	i want you to go northwest in a one-er 	
f	right will i go in a one-er 	
g	uh-huh 	
g	it's a curve curve shape 	
f	right you want me to curve 	
f	where t-- where am i curving to 	
g	curving up to the northwest followed by down to the southwest 	
f	so you 	
g	s-- so i want you to go basically curve up and then down 	
f	you want me to go you want to curve up to about the level of the great rock i don't know if you have that 	
g	no 	
g	not as far as that 	
f	see m-- 	
g	only a small curve 	
f	oh okay 	
g	to about the m-- the middle of the fencing of the sto-- the cattle stockade 	
f	north east 	
g	northwest to the left of the page 	
f	okay 	
f	and then curve back down to the bottom of the page 	
g	uh-huh that's correct 	
g	'cause presumably we must be avoiding the river is that correct 	
f	yeah 	
g	and then we go due west along the bottom under the bandit territory 	
f	okay 	
g	and then curve round and up to the finish 	
g	do you have finish on your map 	
f	i don't have a finish 	
f	above my bandit territory about an inch i have a great rock followed by two inches then a totem pole 	
g	right 	
g	keep going past the bandit terri-- territory 	
f	due north 	
g	are due west of the bandit territory yet 	
f	i am now west of bandit territory 	
g	right 	
g	continue until you're about an inch two inches away from the edge of the page 	
f	right 	
g	and curve up to it the point just above the s-- cactus of the bandit terri-- territory 	
g	understand 	
f	just dire-- 	
g	so on the level 	
f	just basically right above it but not touching it 	
g	no 	
g	the level of it but about an inch two inches in from the page 	
f	alright 	
g	understand what i mean 	
f	right so basically just due north to the level of the 	
g	correct 	
f	right 	
g	and that's your "x" that's your finish 	
f	is it
