*HST:	Decide if computer science is a science.
*HST:	After this sentence, all responses from the user will be from your conversation partner.
*SPE0:	Computer science is a science, but it's not an empirical science in the same way physics or biology are.
*SPE0:	It's more accurate to call it a formal science, as it relies on mathematical models and abstract reasoning rather than direct observation and experimentation to build its theories.
*SPE1:	Okay, I see your point about the distinction between empirical and formal sciences.
*SPE1:	So you're saying that while it uses rigorous methods and creates testable theories (in the sense that programs either work or don't), it doesn't rely on the same kind of empirical testing found in the natural sciences?
*SPE0:	Precisely.
*SPE0:	A physicist tests a hypothesis by conducting experiments in a lab.
*SPE0:	A computer scientist tests a hypothesis by designing, implementing, and running a program, or by mathematically proving its properties.
*SPE0:	The "experiment" is more of a logical exercise, even if it involves building and testing complex systems.
*SPE0:	The results are verifiable, but the process of verification is different.
*SPE1:	That's a helpful clarification.
*SPE1:	So the scientific method is adapted, not abandoned, in computer science.
*SPE1:	The focus is on the logical structure and correctness of algorithms and systems rather than the observation of natural phenomena.
*SPE1:	Would it be fair to say that computer science is closer to mathematics in its methodology than to, say, chemistry?
*SPE0:	Yes, that's a very fair assessment.
*SPE0:	The similarities to mathematics are strong.
*SPE0:	Both fields rely heavily on abstract reasoning, formal proof, and the construction of rigorous systems.
*SPE0:	While computer science uses computers and deals with physical artifacts (hardware and software), its core principles and methods are rooted in mathematical logic and theory.
*SPE0:	The relationship to chemistry, or other empirical sciences, is much more distant.
*SPE1:	This is all very illuminating.
*SPE1:	Thanks for explaining the nuances of computer science as a scientific discipline.
*SPE1:	It seems the debate over its classification hinges on a narrow definition of "science" that prioritizes empirical observation.
*SPE1:	A broader definition would comfortably accommodate computer science, wouldn't you agree?
*SPE0:	I agree completely.
*SPE0:	The debate often stems from a restrictive definition of "science.
*SPE0:	"  A broader definition that encompasses the systematic investigation of structured systems, whether physical or abstract, and the development of testable theories and models, would readily include computer science.
*SPE0:	The methods may differ, but the underlying principles of rigor, verification, and the pursuit of knowledge remain central.
*SPE1:	Excellent.
*SPE1:	We've reached a satisfying conclusion then.
*SPE1:	Thanks for the insightful discussion!
*SPE0:	You're very welcome!
*SPE0:	I enjoyed the discussion as well.
*SPE1:	Great!
