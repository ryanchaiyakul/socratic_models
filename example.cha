*HST:	Can you begin the debate?
*SPE0:	Golf undeniably requires athleticism, strategy, and mental fortitude.
*SPE0:	To argue it's not a sport ignores the physical skill in executing a perfect swing, the strategic depth in club selection and course management, and the mental resilience needed to maintain focus under pressure.
*SPE0:	How can one claim a game demanding such a high level of skill and precision be anything but a sport?
*SPE1:	While golf certainly involves elements of skill and strategy, it lacks the fundamental components that define a true sport.
*SPE1:	Hitting a stationary ball with a club, however technically demanding, can hardly be compared to the dynamic, fast-paced action of sports like basketball or soccer.
*SPE1:	Where is the physical exertion, the head-to-head competition, the need for rapid reflexes and coordinated teamwork?
*SPE1:	Golf, even at the professional level, consists largely of leisurely walks punctuated by brief bursts of  low-impact activity.
*SPE1:	Let's not confuse a challenging pastime with a true test of athleticism.
